					<description><![CDATA[Your article was shared with me by a tennis friend, and wow has it really helped my game! I was already practicing 478 breathing before tough matches, and I realized after reading your article that this is a pre-game ritual so I am using it now before every match. I am working on incorporating all 9 of your tips as well. I do have one question about a situation that is so bothersome to me in tennis. We have one club in my area that consistently downgrades their players&#039; ratings for internal leagues to ensure wins.  They also have some bad sportsmanlike (Cobra Kai-like) tactics to get in the heads of their opponents.  When I have a match at this club, I dread it and I automatically tighten up.  How do you suggest staying positive in this case, even before the match starts?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chad - I really enjoyed your article. I read it this evening right after getting home from a lousy match at my club. I&#039;m new to the club and was invited to join a weekly men&#039;s doubles league. I had played with a couple of the guys previously and they recommended me to the group organizer. Some of these guys have been playing together for a few years and a number of them compete on a USTA team together. I&#039;m probably middle of the pack from an ability level, but I played terribly. I was nervous from the get-go, hitting wild service returns, missing easy forehand approach shots and framing easy volleys. I was so frustrated all night, worried what these guys were thinking of me and I actually started picturing myself missing shots before I even hit them! Your comment about hitting out on the ball really resonated with me because I was so tentative and trying to play it safe but ended up leaving the ball in the net or serving up an easy volley for my opponent. I struggle with some anxiety in other aspects of my life (i.e. work) but tennis should be fun, right? I&#039;m excited to get back out there again so I can &quot;hit the delete button&quot; and will use your strategies for focusing between points and not worrying about winning or losing. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/mental-toughness-in-tennis-9-easy-ways-to-conquer-your-fears/#comment-413&quot;&gt;Rustin Reyes&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you for taking the time to read my article. Mental toughness is like physical toughness, it takes time to cultivate. Don&#039;t put any added pressure on him, as mental toughness is something that can only be learned from the inside and not from a coach or father. My advice would be to get him involved in the martial arts, like boxing, BJJ, or wrestling. Not to see him get hurt, but I think fighting is a great way to improve mental toughness for tennis. I used to box and do BJJ and it really helped me. I wouldn&#039;t have him involved to the point he gets hurt or puts a lot of time into it, only so that he gets pushed past his comfort zone. In tennis, it&#039;s very easy to give up and sometimes it&#039;s hard to tell when someone does. But in fighting, it&#039;s pretty evident. That&#039;s my advice, Rustin. You can take it or leave it. Learning a martial art is also just good for self defense for life purposes. Of course with covid I don&#039;t know if gyms are open. But in normal times this is what I would do if I had a son.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi I just read your article, great article first of all I really enjoyed reading it.  I have a question, my son is 12 years old and is having some trouble with the mental side of his tennis, but if he figures it out he&#039;ll really improve a lot.  His game, technique, and physical aspect is already very ahead of his age group, his coach and I keep reminding him to stay positive when things aren&#039;t going well.  Somedays it&#039;s great others it&#039;s not, I was wondering if you could give me any advice to give to him.
Thanks
