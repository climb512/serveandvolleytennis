										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to serving in tennis, we all want more power. While placement and consistency are just as important, power seems to be all that people talk about on the serve.</p>
<p>We marvel at watching Serena Williams and John Isner hit 120-140 mph serves. Yet most club players can’t even break the 100 mph mark. Is it because they lack power?</p>
<p>Well, yes and no. Some players have power and others don’t, but technique is also definitely a big factor when it comes to hitting fast serves.</p>
<p><strong>But some players have solid technique and still lack the serve velocity they wish to achieve. You may be one of those people. So what can we do to increase serve power?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The solution can be found in doing certain gym exercises that will increase the fast twitch muscle fibers in our bodies. These serve exercises will improve our explosiveness, helping us achieve higher serve velocities.</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to point out that serve velocity comes from three distinct phases of the serve motion. I’ve listed them below.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Racket Drop</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pronation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Knee bend and explosion upwards of body</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These three parts of the serve account for almost all the power. If you lack in one, you’ll never achieve your maximum potential for serve power. If you lack in two, you have your work cut out for you.</p>
<p>I could get into a long discussion of each one. But I’ll give a quick summary of each. My point is that we need to do gym exercises that will improve the ability to do each phase better.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />

</script></p>
<p><strong>Racket Drop</strong> – This is the part of the serve swing where the tip of the racket will drop near the server’s lower back. Generally, the deeper the racket drop, the more power is produced. Flexibility is key here in the shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>Pronation</strong> – I’ve discussed pronation in many <a href="/5-steps-to-a-great-tennis-serve-for-beginners-with-pics-and-video/">other blog posts</a> and videos. It’s basically swiveling of the radius and ulna bones in the forearm. If you place your arm straight out in front of you with palm up, that’s called supination. Now turn your palm down by just swiveling your arm. When your palm is down, that’s called pronation. Pronation can produce tremendous racket head speed in a very short space.</p>
<p><strong>Knee Bend And Explosion Of The Body Upward</strong> – This is the most crucial part of the serve motion and the one we can improve the most with gym exercises. This is also the phase that almost all club players struggle with. If you watch a professional tennis player’s serve motion compared with a club player, this part is the most glaring difference.</p>
<p>Why is that true? Because most club players don’t bend their knees enough and explode up into the air. They also don’t jump forward enough. Doing so requires strength, power, and explosion from the legs.</p>
<p>So why do club players suffer in this part of the serve? I believe there are several good reasons. One is that they weren’t trained to do so. Professional players are trained from an early age to explode into the serve.</p>
<p>The second reason is that club players don’t possess the energy and athleticism to consistently explode up into the ball. Many club players are older people with less-than-perfect knees. The upward explosion into the ball is an athletic move that many club players can’t perform.</p>
<p>I think we see pro players on TV so often that we take for granted how much they are actually jumping up to hit the ball. And that takes a lot of energy to do over 3-5 sets. Most club players barely get off the ground.</p>
<p>I’ve personally worked with older players (age 50-70) who had solid technique on their serve motion but could barely break 80-85 mph. Why? Because they had little knee bend and almost zero explosion in this third phase of the serve.</p>
<p>While players of all ages can benefit from these simple gym exercises for the serve (that I’m about to go into), those with the weakest legs may benefit the most.<br />
I’m going to recommend the best gym exercises for the serve for each of the three phases. The third phase (upward explosion) is the most important so that one will have the most exercises for you to do.</p>
<p>Practice these exercises twice a week if possible. After 4-5 weeks, you should start to see and feel a difference in your serve. I believe it’s possible for everyone to achieve a 5 mph increase in their serve after 5-6 weeks of doing these exercises twice a day.</p>
<p>If you continue doing them and increase the resistance while working on your form, there’s no reason why a 10-15 mph increase can’t be made within three months.<br />
Alright, let’s get into the serve exercises starting with the ones for the racket drop phase first.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Racket Drop Exercises</h2>
<p>1. <strong>One Arm Cable Triceps Extension</strong> – This is a great exercise to build up the triceps muscle of the upper arm. The triceps is responsible gets worked when we bend the arm and then straighten it. For this exercise, a cable machine is needed. Work each arm with the same intensity, but of course, the hitting arm is where we’ll see results on the serve. If you don’t have access to a cable machine, you can use a light dumbbell.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Over The Head Medicine Ball Throws</strong> – In this one you hold a medicine ball in back of your head and throw it as far as you can in front of you. It would be best if you have a wall you can throw it at. This works the fast-twitch muscle fibers of the arms and shoulders and simulates the action of the arm on the serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pronation Exercises</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Forearm Pronates</strong> &#8211; Hold a light weight in your hand with arm outstretched in front of you and palm up. Your arm should be straight. If you don’t have a light weight, you can use your racket. Now turn your palm down. Repeat over and over until you feel the burn in your forearm. This exercise will build the muscles in your forearm required for faster pronation on the serve.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Motorcycle Revs</strong> – Hold a barbell or dumbbell in your hands. Your arms can hang down in front of your thighs. Now flex your wrists so that your palms move towards you as if you were revving a motorcycle. Hold for a second and return to the neutral position you started in. Then repeat and continue until you feel a burn in your forearm. This exercise really built up the underside of my forearms and grip strength, which is ideal for really hitting any shot in tennis.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Reverse Motorcycle Revs</strong> – Start in the same place, with you holding weights with arms hanging straight down your body. Your palms should be facing you. Now instead of using flexion, move your wrists the opposite way, which is called extension. This exercise works the top side of your forearm. Do as many reps as you can until your forearm burns. These forearm exercises will really help you to pronate quicker.</p>

<h2>Knee Bend and Explosion (Jumping) Exercises</h2>
<p>This segment will have the most exercises, since this is the most important phase of the serve, as already mentioned. These exercises will take more out of you physically but are necessary to build the explosion you need for a powerful serve.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Squat and Jumps</strong> – Grab two light dumbbells (10-20 lbs) and hold one in each hand. Stand on a padded or soft floor with both hands holding the weights by your sides. Now squat down as far as you can go. Once your knees are fully bent and you can’t go down anymore, explode upwards as hard as you can. The point is to jump into the air as high as you can go. When you land, quickly drop down and repeat the process. I recommend doing no more than 10 reps per set and 2-3 sets max. This exercise is great for creating an explosion on the jump phase of the serve.</p>
<p>2. <strong>One Legged Box Step Ups</strong> – Stand in front of a platform or stable box. The height should be around 12-20 inches, depending on your height. Place one foot on the box with knee slightly bent; the other foot should be on the ground. Now, spring upwards by pushing off with the foot on the box – the other foot will leave the floor. The foot on the box will be on the toes when you spring up. Once you do this, return the foot (that’s in the air) to the floor and repeat. Do 10-15 reps and then alternate your feet so you push off with the opposite foot. This exercise is especially good because it trains each leg at a time. On the tennis serve, you push off with more force on your front leg (the left leg for righties), so make sure you train the left leg especially hard.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Frog Jumps</strong> – For this exercise, no gym or equipment is needed. You’re basically going to be jumping forward as far as you can and keep repeating until your legs are tired. To do this exercise, squat down half way to the floor. Put your hands to the sides and slightly behind you. Now jump upwards and outwards as far as possible. Your arms should cast forward in sequence with the jump. This builds plyometric strength in your legs and simulates the forward jump of the serve. My recommendation would be to do 6-8 jumps in one set and 2-3 sets per session.</p>
<p>These are all the exercises you should do to improve your tennis serve power. As an option, you can do squats, leg press, deadlifts, and calf raises. I would recommend doing them as fast as you can with weights that are 40-50% of your max.</p>
<p>By doing that, you train your body to be more explosive. If you do heavy, slow lifts with near max weight at low reps, that’s not bad, but explosive movements is more of what you want.</p>
<p>If you look at the most powerful servers on tour, they’re mostly guys and girls with wire-like frames. More muscle does not always equate to more power.<br />
You can probably do all of the exercises featured in this post (with the exception of the four leg exercises I just mentioned) in one session. If you can, do two sessions per week, spacing them three days apart.</p>
<p>If I didn’t mention the rep range for a specific exercise, just do it until you are tired, or your muscles burn. You can then stop and that’s the rep range you should shoot for on each set – at least initially.</p>
<p>If you can complete two sessions per week, I think you’ll see a difference in your serve in just a few weeks. These exercises are designed to hit all the muscles that play into the key phases of the serve.</p>
<p>Let me know how these gym exercises for the serve help you. If you have any questions about them, let me know in the comment section below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re new to tennis, you may be unaware that there are typical regimens tennis players employ to warm up. And if you’ve been playing tennis for a while and are not quite sure how to warm up properly, this post will tell you how.</p>
<p>When I first started playing tennis, I wasn’t sure of how to warm up, so I’d hit the ball a few times and just start. But when I joined my college tennis team, everyone warmed up the same way.</p>
<p>This is the basic structure of what a proper tennis warm up looks like. Overall, it shouldn’t take more than 10-15 minutes. I’m listing the events in sequential order.</p>
<p>The first one is mini tennis and it’s optional. Some people like to start with it and some skip it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mini Tennis</li>
<li>Groundstroke practice (both players on the baseline)</li>
<li>Volley practice (one player at net and one on baseline – then alternate)</li>
<li>Overheads (one player at net and one on baseline – then alternate)</li>
<li>Serve practice (each player takes turns serving from both the deuce and ad sides)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really it. For the remainder of the article, I’ll go into more detail on the warm up and how to properly perform each part of it.</p>
<p>I’ll also give you a few tips you can use during the warm up to make it easier for you during the match. Some players take the warm up for granted, but it’s a very important factor in gauging your opponent, court conditions and your level of play that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stretching And Mini Tennis</h2>
<p>Before you even step onto the court, it’s a wise idea to stretch. Personally, I never stretch because I never feel the need to. I’m like a gazelle who’s always ready to sprint away from an attacking lion – I just go!</p>
<p>But most weekend warriors and even long-time athletes like to stretch. Tennis uses all the muscles in the body so for that reason a full-body stretch is helpful.</p>
<p>When I was on the tennis team, we would stretch our arms, shoulders, back, hips, and legs. You also might want to warm up by doing light jogging or moving exercises before starting the “official” warm up.</p>
<p>Once you feel loose, you are your partner can take to the court for mini tennis. Again, mini tennis is an optional way to start the warm up; some people (like me) prefer going straight to the baseline.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>If you want to begin with mini tennis, both you are your partner should stand at the service line (usually near the midline) and gently rally back and forth. If a ball comes to you in the air, just lightly volley it back.</p>
<p>When doing mini tennis, pay attention to your forehand and backhand form. Make sure it’s smooth and relaxed with a full follow through. Since it’s mini tennis, you’ll generally be swinging slower than normal.</p>
<p>Remember, mini tennis is mostly a control drill. Do mini tennis for no more than two minutes and then move back to the baseline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Groundstroke Practice At The Baseline</h2>
<p>Almost all professional tennis players start their warm ups at the baseline. Most people prefer to warm up this way – forgoing mini tennis.</p>
<p>This is not to say that professional players never do mini tennis. Most do but they’ll typically do it during practice sessions or in their pre-match warm up.</p>
<p>When you start this part of the warm up, it’s best to be in the middle of the court and a few feet in back of the baseline. It’s important that you hit to your partner and not try to hit winners.</p>
<p>When playing tennis, you’ll run into players of varying skill and levels. Some people have little control over where they hit and will spray balls during this part of the warm up.</p>
<p>If so, it can be difficult to establish a good rhythm. In that case, you either need to find people to play at a higher level or just cut this part of the warm up short.</p>
<p>Chances are you’ll win the match if your opponent has that much trouble hitting down the middle to you.</p>
<p>But some opponents do have good control but try to hit winners in the warm up. That’s a selfish way to warm up and doesn’t help you at all. When this happens, I’ll say something to my opponent.</p>
<p>If he persists in hitting to the sidelines, I’ll just say, “I’m ready to start playing – I don’t need to warm up anymore”. If my opponent insists he needs more warm up, I’ll refuse. There’s no rule that says you have to participate in a warm up.</p>
<p>Typically, this scenario doesn’t happen, but it can. The best warm ups are when both players can hit relaxed groundstrokes down the middle of the court.</p>
<p>Doing so gives you a chance to work on your forehands and backhands. You can definitely throw some slices in as well. Towards the end of this part of the warm up, feel free to hit some hard shots as well.</p>
<p>For me, this should be the longest part of the warm up at about 4-5 minutes. During this phase of the warm up, take note of the court conditions. Are they playing fast? What direction is the wind? Is the sun a factor and on which side?</p>
<p>Also, take note of your opponent. If you’re playing someone new, which side is their strength and which their weakness? For most players, their backhand is their weaker side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Volley Practice</h2>
<p>Once you complete the groundstroke part of the warm up, one player will move to the net – the other can stay at the baseline. The player at the net will take volley practice.</p>
<p>This part of the warm up can be made better if both players hit to each other. It takes some control, but the volley player has to be skilled enough to hit volleys that can be handled by the baseliner.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for both players to make more mistakes at this point in the warm up. If so, just move on and hit another shot. When I’m on the baseline, I like to hit to both my opponent’s forehand volley and backhand volley.</p>
<p>I also like to give them high volleys and low volleys (close to the net). I’ll also hit directly into their body. In this way, I can gauge how good of a volley player they are and where they have a weakness.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>When it’s your turn to come to net, work on practicing your volleys on both sides. Hit most of the volleys back to your opponent, but towards the end, you can direct a few volleys away from your opponent. You may also want to throw in a couple of drop volleys.</p>
<p>Remember, you practice like you play, so make sure you’re not being lackadaisical in your warm ups. Move your feet and volley like you would in a match.<br />
For this part of the warm up, each player should volley for no more than two minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Overhead Practice</h2>
<p>After completing groundstroke warmup, one player will come to the net. That player will take volley practice. Before returning to the baseline to allow the other player to come up, he or she will stay at the net for overhead practice.</p>
<p>The player will take a couple of minutes of overhead practice and then return to the baseline. Then the other player will come to the baseline for volley practice and then overhead practice.</p>
<p>Once that’s done, both players can move onto the final part of the warm up, which is serve practice. I wanted to point that out to you in case you were confused.</p>
<p>Basically, the volley and overhead practice go in sequential order where one player practices both and then the other player practices both. I just broke them into different segments in this post to clearly illustrate the different parts of the warm up.</p>
<p>During the overhead part of the warm up, the net player will work only on hitting overheads. The baseline player will hit only lobs. As a baseline player, try to hit your lobs to the forehand side of the opponent.</p>
<p>Lobs to the backhand are too difficult for most players. Also, keep your overheads from going too short (falling right by the net) or too long (landing near the baseline). Aiming for the service line is a good idea.</p>
<p>You can hit lobs right off the returns – if your opponent hits in your direction. If your opponent doesn’t hit right to you, it’s fine, as overheads can be difficult to control.</p>
<p>When you’re at the net for overhead practice, keep your feet moving and do the best job you can at setting up early. Turn your shoulders right away and move into position to hit the perfect overhead.</p>
<p>I like to hit the first few overheads directly to my opponent and the last few to the corners. This gives me a good warm up on my overheads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Serve Practice</h2>
<p>Once you complete the groundstroke, volley, and overhead practice, you’re ready for serve practice. At the professional level, both players hit serves at the same time.</p>
<p>Professional players do this to save time and because they have an unlimited number of balls with ball kids to help. But at the club level, we don’t have that luxury, so one player at a time will practice their serve.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter which player goes first. Usually, the person with more balls in their pocket can start serving first.</p>
<p>If that’s you, start on the deuce side and hit three serves. Typically, the returner will just collect the balls without hitting them back.</p>
<p>The returner should then serve three serves to you – on the deuce side again. You’ll collect the balls and then the process repeats. You serve three times and your opponent will serve three times – all on the deuce side.</p>
<p>Once complete, both you and your opponent will switch to the ad side. Go ahead and hit three serves to your opponent. Your opponent will collect each serve and then serve three times back to you.</p>
<p>Repeat the process once more (so you each hit three more serves on the ad side) and then the warm up is complete. There’s no hard-fast rule saying you can’t take even more serve practice.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />

</script></p>
<p>I’m just giving you the protocol that most tennis players go through as a ritual during warm up. After both me and my partner each take six serves on both sides of the court, I’ll always ask them if they’re ready to play.</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to ask your opponent this then just assuming they’re ready. Sometimes your opponent will ask you if they can serve a few more times. It’s always a good idea to let them do so, as long as it’s just a minute or two more of warm up.</p>
<p>Once both you and your opponent agree that warm up is complete, you’re ready to begin the match. At this point, you can spin your racket to see which player goes first in deciding whether to serve or receive.</p>
<p>The player who wins the toss can also forgo that decision and just choose which side they want. Whichever option the player who wins the toss decides (serve/return or side) the other player gets to choose the other.</p>
<p>For example, if I win the toss and elect to serve first, my opponent gets to decide which side of the court they want to return from.</p>
<p>However, if I win the toss and decide which side of the court I want to begin on, my opponent gets to decide if they want to serve or return first.</p>
<p>During the serve warm up, it’s a good idea to practice both your first and second serve. You only have six serves on each side during a traditional tennis warm up, so it’s a wise idea to hit three first serves and three second serves.</p>
<p>I also like to vary the placement of the serves, hitting both sides of the service box. It’s also important to take note of the sun in the day time, any wind, and the lights at night.</p>
<p>If the side you’re serving on is particularly bad because of the lighting or sun, do your best to start serving on the other side of the court.</p>
<p>During serve practice, you can also gauge how good your opponent serves to a degree. He or she might not be serving at 100% yet, but often you can get a good sense of the speed, spin, and placement you’ll be dealing with.</p>
<p>By the way, during serve practice, if you serve into the net, just pick the balls up and give them to your opponent to serve. If you need to take more serve practice, tell your opponent after you both take all your serves (six on each side).</p>
<p>Some players like to hit six consecutive serves and then give you a chance to hit six consecutive serves. That’s fine too, as there is no one set rule or way to warm up.</p>
<p>The main point of warm up is to loosen the body and be able to play better during the match. The total time of the warm up should not exceed 15 minutes, but if it does, there’s no penalty.</p>
<p>However, in tournament and league matches (or when paying a lot of money for courts), time is often at a premium. In those cases, limiting the warm ups to 10-15 minutes is essential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a fan of ATP or WTA tennis, you know that rain will usually delay or end a professional tennis match. This is usually decided by the tournament referee when he or she deems it too slippery or unsafe for the match to continue.</p>
<p>Sometimes the players will take it upon themselves to stop the match, but the referee has the final say. In club tennis, there is no referee and the players decide when to call it quits.</p>
<p>In theory, you could play tennis in a light rain, but definitely not in a strong rain. The determining factor is the intensity of the rain, the court surface, and how slippery or not the court is becoming.</p>
<p>Most club matches are played on either hard court or clay. There are two types of clay – green clay and red clay, but green is more popular.</p>
<p>Green clay is often referred to as “har-true” and red clay is a finer, softer type of clay that absorbs water slightly more. If enough rain comes down, it will affect any surface (hard court or clay) making it too slippery to risk playing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can You Play Tennis On A Wet Court?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can play tennis on a wet court, but it depends how wet. On hard courts, you’ll have more traction than on clay, but the lines can be very slippery.</p>
<p>If playing on wet hard courts, you need to be careful around the lines. You should also not run 100% speed or try to move too quickly. Additionally, if puddles begin forming, you should stop playing, as the balls will soon become water-logged and lose most of their bounce.</p>
<p>Clay courts are better able to absorb water than hard courts. But once they get saturated, your level of traction will be much worse than a hard court.</p>
<p>Once clay is saturated with water, it becomes like mud and it’s nearly impossible to have traction. In periods of light rain, you can certainly play on clay. The deciding point to stop is when the clay turns to mud.</p>
<p>If the clay turns to mud in a light rain, stop playing, as you’re only risking falling or injuring yourself. Hang out by the court for a bit and monitor the weather.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take For Tennis Courts To Dry After Rain?</h2>
<p>If a light rain stops, it will usually require 15-25 minutes for clay courts to dry enough to be played on. This is only in light rain.</p>
<p>When the rain comes down heavy and the clay court is mudded up, it will take at least an hour or more to dry. I would say in most cases, heavy rain on average takes 2-3 hours to dry for clay courts during the day. At night, it could be longer due to the lack of sun.</p>
<p>On hard courts, the time for drying can take longer. If a light rain occurs and the court looks wet and the lines are slippery, I recommend stopping play. And if puddles occur, you certainly want to stop.</p>
<p>After a light rain on a hard court, it could take up to an hour for the court to dry. This really depends on the material used to build the court and the time of day.</p>
<p>I’ve seen some hard courts dry in 30 minutes while others took over an hour. Some courts are just better irrigated, while others seem to collect water in spots and puddle up.</p>
<p>If a hard rain hits for 10 minutes or more, you could be looking at several hours before the court dries.</p>
<p>To summarize, you can still play tennis on a wet court, but it depends on how much traction you have, how hard it’s raining, and what kind of surface you’re playing on (hard court or clay).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Does Water Affect Tennis Balls?</h2>
<p>All tennis balls absorb water on the furry or hairy part of them. This causes the ball to be water-logged and gain weight (usually a 1-3 ounces). Keep in mind the tennis ball itself is only 2 ounces.</p>
<p>When this happens, the ball definitely slows down, does not bounce as high and does not travel as fast or far. Furthermore, water will come off the ball every time it is hit – usually splashing you in the process.</p>
<p>It’s no fun playing tennis with water-logged balls. So even if you have good traction on a wet court, the tennis balls will absorb the moisture and they will severely affect your game.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />

</script></p>
<p>This is a big reason why playing tennis in the rain can be difficult. The only solution is to wait until the courts dry or put new, dry tennis balls in play.</p>
<p>If the courts have a lot of moisture on them, then the new balls will quickly collect that and become water-logged again. That’s why I recommend not playing when the courts are wet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Does Rain Ruin Tennis Balls?</h2>
<p>No, rain will not ruin the tennis ball in that it can’t be used again. But it will make the tennis ball practically unplayable for the time it is wet.</p>
<p>If you open new balls and it rains soon after, the balls will likely get water-logged if you play for a bit. You’ll see the balls don’t bounce that well and they’ll feel heavier.</p>
<p>As we mentioned before, tennis balls absorb moisture, which is why they lose performance when wet. If this happens, just put the balls back in the can or your bag and dry them off when you get home.</p>
<p>When the tennis balls dry, they should be fine to use again for practice or a friendly match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Is The Best Way To Dry Off A Wet Court?</h2>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2017" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1024px-Citi_Open_Rain_Delay.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1024px-Citi_Open_Rain_Delay.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1024px-Citi_Open_Rain_Delay-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1024px-Citi_Open_Rain_Delay-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regard to clay courts, the only thing you can do is wait. There is no tool or blower that will dry clay courts. The best course of action (to avoid them getting wet in the first place) is to place a tarp over them when it rains.</p>
<p>In this way, you can begin playing as soon as the rain stops, and the tarp is removed. Tarps are not commonly used in most tennis clubs.</p>
<p>But they can often be seen at such prestigious events as Wimbledon, where a crew of 20 balls boys can cover a court in less than a minute.</p>
<p>When it comes to hard courts, the best option to dry a wet court is with a squeegee. This is a tool that is specially designed to push water off the court. It also spreads it out so that the water can dry faster.</p>
<p>Most good hard courts have at least one squeegee nearby. The squeegee should be used when it stops raining. It will take some time to dry a wet court with a squeegee (depending on the level of wetness).</p>
<p>On hard courts with just a few small puddles, I’ve been able to dry the courts in 5-10 minutes with a squeegee. But on very wet courts, it can take 15-25 minutes to squeegee the entire court.</p>
<p>In addition, you may need to allow time for the court to dry, even though you moved most of the puddles off the court. For places that stubbornly won’t dry (or if you don’t have a squeegee), an old towel, shirt or rag works well.</p>
<p>While you won’t be able to dry an entire court with one towel, shirt or rag, you can hit a few bad spots and dry them faster than with a squeegee in most cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can You Play Tennis On A Wet Court? What Is The Best Way To Play Tennis In The Rain?</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, yes, it’s possible to play tennis on a wet court. Here are some helpful pieces of advice for playing tennis in the rain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your sneakers have good traction. If you’re playing on clay, you should be using clay court tennis sneakers that have extra material on the bottom for grip.</li>
<li>Wear a hat to protect your head or glasses from getting wet. If you wear glasses (like I do), it’s nearly impossible to play with water all over your lenses.</li>
<li>Bring extra towels. You may need them to dry off your racket and body.</li>
<li>Bring extra tennis balls. One can is not enough in wet weather. I recommend bringing at least two cans, if not three to play in the rain. When the first can becomes water-logged, let them dry off out of the rain. You can then put the second fresh can into play.</li>
<li>Bring extra rackets or over-grips. In the rain, the handle of the racket can easily get wet. If this happens, it’s difficult to grip the racket. For this reason, it’s beneficial to bring extra over-grips and rackets.</li>
<li>Bring extra shirts. Depending on the intensity of rain, your shirt may become water-logged too, making you feel heavy, wet and uncomfortable. I recommend bringing at least three shirts (if not more) for play in the rain.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When playing in the rain, it’s ultimately your judgment or call as to whether you can go on our not. There have been times I really wanted to play, but the courts just became too wet.</p>
<p>In cases like that, better to air on the side of caution. I’ve played complete matches in a light rain on clay. But hard courts are different. Once it gets to a certain point, they are pretty much unplayable.</p>
<p>I hope the information in this post helps you. The next time it rains while you play, you’ll know what to expect and how to handle it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been playing tennis regularly for 25 years. I coach tennis, I live tennis and I breathe tennis. It goes without saying that I’ve made many tennis mistakes in that time.</p>
<p>When I first started, I made mistake after mistake. It took me years of playing and meditating on the game to realize those mistakes and correct them.</p>
<p>I truly wish I knew then what I know now. My motivation for writing this article is so that you can learn from my experience.</p>
<p><strong>Without any more delay, here are the top 20 mistakes tennis players need to correct. If you can learn from even one of these, then it was worth your time to read this post.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Never Assume The Ball Is Out</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2004" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/outornot.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="449" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/outornot.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/02/outornot-300x168.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/02/outornot-768x431.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people I play often assume my ball is going long. They abruptly stop moving and then my ball falls in. They’ll often say something like, “I thought that ball was going five feet out!”</p>
<p>In tennis it’s wise to never assume the ball is going on unless it’s blatantly obvious. It’s better to play the ball and hit it, even if you think it may go out. If you take a swing, you can still call it out.</p>
<p>But if you don’t swing and the ball goes in, then you’ve lost the point for sure. One way to circumvent this mistake is to just run down everything. It’s a good drill and habit to get into anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Always Carry The Proper Equipment</h2>
<p>I know a lot of players who show up to matches ill-prepared. They don’t have grips, carry one racket and some don’t even have a tennis bag.</p>
<p>It’s always a good idea to show up to a match with everything you’ll need to perform your best. It may be annoying to acquire all the stuff you need, but once you do, it’s in your bag and done.</p>
<p>Here are the essential items I carry to every match. If you’re new to tennis, these are great items to keep in your bag: at least three rackets, new grips, hats, extra shirts, water, wrist bands, a towel, vibration dampeners, tennis balls, an energy bar, sunblock, and a racket weight.</p>
<p>Showing up prepared means you’re serious about tennis and serious about winning. It doesn’t take much, so learn to come prepared to all your matches and you’ll play better for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Never Judge A Book By Its Cover</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2002" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/a-fist-pounding.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/a-fist-pounding.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/02/a-fist-pounding-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/02/a-fist-pounding-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve probably played over several hundred people in the last couple of decades. Sometimes I’ll play someone I’ve never met or seen play before.</p>
<p>One thing I quickly learned is never to judge someone’s play on looks. I’ve seen the most unathletic, dumpy-looking players be able to hit the most extraordinary shots. Those players could do things I could only dream about.</p>
<p>Never assume you can beat someone on appearance alone. Always judge by the level of play. The same holds true for players that look good.</p>
<p>I’ve played against athletic-looking, young players with great stroke technique, and they were some of the easiest matches I’ve played. If you count yourself out before the match begins, you can play yourself right into an unnecessary loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Practice Like You Play</h2>
<p>A friend of mine, who was like a mentor to me early on, always reiterated, “you practice like you play.” This means you should practice as hard as you play.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t see many players heeding that advice. When I first began playing tennis, I would practice very nonchalantly.</p>
<p>But I realized that to maximize my practice sessions, I needed to practice as hard as I worked in matches. Once I did, my game evolved, and I saw noticeable improvements.</p>
<p>The next time you are on the practice court, be intense and focused. Practice is your time to improve, not goof off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Use The Best Racket And Strings You Can Find</h2>
<p>I know great players may tell you differently, but for most of us club hacks, which racket you use has a huge impact on your game. Many club players I know use old rackets with bad string.</p>
<p>If you’re an avid tennis player, you need to upgrade your racket and string now. It may be a surprise to hear this, but you should be changing rackets every 3-4 years at max. New racket technology comes out every year and after 1-2 years, rackets begin to lose their “pop”.</p>
<p>Do you want to know the fastest way to improve in tennis? Purchase yourself a new racket and put good strings in it. By good strings, I mean 17-gauge strings with good feel. Try to avoid the cheap 16-gauge crap.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what racket to buy, try demoing several different rackets from your local pro shop or an online site like tenniswarehouse. If you call them, they’ll give you suggestions. Trust me, rackets make a big difference in play.  If you like the serve and volley game &#8212; which is probably why you are here in the first place &#8212; check out our specific recommendations <a href="/the-best-5-rackets-for-serve-and-volley-in-2018/">here</a>.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<h2>Focus On The Process, Not The Results</h2>
<p>As you may know from reading my blog and seeing my youtube videos, I’m a tennis coach. When I teach experienced players, they often have big expectations of improving right away.</p>
<p>Often during a lesson, I’ll tweak or change a player’s technique. Not surprisingly, they play worse for a while, as it takes time to adapt to new changes. I notice the player gets awful discouraged when the new changes don’t work right away.</p>
<p>At that point, I’ll tell them to focus on the process, not the results. Too often we get caught up thinking the results need to be ideal all the time, or else something is flawed. That’s how many of us are programmed to think.</p>
<p>Just remember, when you are improving or learning a new technique in tennis, focus on the actual process (the technique) and not on where the ball is going. You’ll improve a lot faster that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Know That No Player Is Unbeatable</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2006" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/term.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/term.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/02/term-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/02/term-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of you play matches. Some of those players you beat every time. Other players beat you every time. And against some players, it’s a toss-up on who plays better that day.</p>
<p>For those players who always beat you, never assume going into the match the outcome is certain defeat. It would be wise to think positively, construct a viable game plan and try to execute it throughout the match.</p>
<p>I always try to give myself the best chance of winning. You never know when a better opponent may be off that day. Or, maybe you’ll play the best tennis of your life and end up winning.</p>
<p>Nobody is unbeatable in tennis. I’ve seen poor players beat good players more than a few times in my life. They did it simply by out-hustling them and wanting it more. Always believe in yourself and never give up on the court. Better to go down in flames fighting hard, then tank like a loser and be soft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Say The Score</h2>
<p>This one is important when you play matches. It’s especially important when you play league and tournament matches!</p>
<p>On many occasions in my playing days, I’ve forgotten the score, especially after long points. If you don’t know the score, you can easily end up giving one or two points to your opponent and ultimately the game and match.</p>
<p>When serving, it’s always a good idea to say the score out loud, so your opponent can hear it. In this way, if they contest the score after a point, you can tell them you said the score before every point.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>It also helps you remember the score better too. When your opponent serves to you, it helps to say the score to yourself. In practice matches, I’ll also utter the score out loud before my opponent serves (if he doesn’t).</p>
<p>If the court you’re playing at has pegs or flip cards to keep track of the games, use them. In this way, there’s no disputing the score of the match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Never Argue With Cheaters</h2>
<p>I’ve played quite a few cheaters in my years. These are players who make blatantly bad calls. It’s one thing to call a ball good that misses by an inch, but when it’s six inches out or more, it gets to be ridiculous.</p>
<p>I say never argue with cheaters because you really can’t win. Leopards don’t usually change their spots. So if a player is a cheater, most likely they’ll always be a cheater.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean they cheat you on every call – just the close and important ones it seems. I usually approach cheaters in two ways. One is that I won’t play with them again. The second is much more passive, where I turn the other cheek.</p>
<p>I only turn the other cheek if I know I can beat that player – especially if we are friendly. For example, there are a couple of guys I like, but they often make bad calls in our matches.</p>
<p>Instead of arguing, I just except the call and play on, knowing I can beat them despite a few really bad calls in the match.</p>
<p>If you argue with cheaters, it usually ends bad and someone usually winds up walking off the court. I’ve even seen physical confrontations break out over bad line calls!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Don’t Overhit</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2007" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Angelique-Kerber.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Angelique-Kerber.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Angelique-Kerber-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Angelique-Kerber-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one that really irks me. I see it with a lot of experienced but lower level players I teach. They’re overhitting the ball and making tons of errors.</p>
<p>I believe most players overhit because they see the way professional tennis players hit and think they should be hitting with the same pace. Well, news flash – it ain’t happening!</p>
<p>Yes, racket speed is important. But if you’re not generating enough topspin due to poor technique or whatever the case, your ball is going to fly out or into the net much more than land inside the court.</p>
<p>I tell these players to either generate more spin or slow their swing down a bit. But it often goes in one ear and out the other. Consistency is a lot more important than power when it comes to winning at the club level.</p>
<p>If you hit hard and most of your shots are landing out, you definitely need to heed this advice. Tone it down a bit and watch your level of play rise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Avoid Playing Matches When Changing Your Technique</h2>
<p>When you make a change in technique, often your level will decline for a period. With practice, you’ll become accustomed to the new technique and you may even be a better player after the change.</p>
<p>One important thing I learned early on is to not play matches in the midst of making big changes to your game. You’ll end up resorting back to what’s comfortable during the match and sabotage the new technique.</p>
<p>Or, if you use the new technique during the match and it doesn’t work well (because it’s not yet ingrained in your muscle memory) you may end up believing it’s unusable and scrap it prematurely.</p>
<p>If you make a wholesale change to your forehand, backhand or serve, work out all the kinks in practice before setting up a match. Once you’re comfortable with the changes, then you’re ready to play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Practice Your Second Serve More Than Any Other Shot</h2>
<p>It’s a tennis cliché that you’re only as good as your second serve. The second serve is the one shot that gives club players the most trouble.</p>
<p>If another player can tee off on your second serve, it means you probably can’t hold serve. And if you can’t hold serve, you can’t win in tennis.</p>
<p>A poor second serve also makes you reluctant to go for a big first serve and puts more pressure on you. So why not learn proper second serve technique and practice it religiously?</p>
<p>When I first started playing, I put the emphasis on my groundstrokes and first serve. But in time, I realized the smartest thing to do was practice my second serve as much as possible.</p>
<p>By doing so, I feel much more confident when serving. I know I can take the chance of missing a big first serve because I have a reliable second serve in my arsenal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Work With The Best Coach Or Tennis Course You Can Find</h2>
<p>When it comes to learning the game of tennis, you only want to learn from the best. This is especially true for new players who are just picking up the rudiments of the game.</p>
<p>If you learn from a coach or tennis course with less-than-optimal technique, your entire game may be permanently flawed. You’ll end ingraining bad habits that will have to be undone months or years later. Trust me, you don’t want that.</p>
<p>Ask around and seek out the best coach in your area. If you can’t afford private lessons or don’t have a great coach in your area, online tennis lessons are your next best option.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Don’t Play The Same Players All The Time</h2>
<p>A lot of tennis players I know get stuck playing the same people over and over. This is mostly a matter of convenience and comfortability.</p>
<p>If you’re only looking for exercise or enjoy playing with a particular person, then great. But if your goal is to improve in tennis as quickly as possible, it’s best to seek out as many different players as you can find.</p>
<p>Tennis is a wonderful sport because no two players are the same. Each one brings a different style to the table that can’t be replicated by anyone else in the world.</p>
<p>Some players hit hard, others are more consistent. Some like to crash the net and some avoid it like the plague. Some players have big serves, some tricky ones, and others use great placement.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill your tennis potential, you need to face as many different styles as possible. I owe a lot of my success in tennis to facing hundreds of different players over the years.</p>
<p>When I’m in a tough match against a player, I can usually recall a player with a similar style and determine the best game plan. The experience you get from playing a wide range of players is invaluable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>If You’re A Singles Player, Don’t Avoid Doubles</h2>
<p>In the early years of my tennis life, I hardly ever played doubles. I loved singles and one-on-one battles. As a result, my net game hardly ever got better.</p>
<p>When I moved to Florida back in 2007, many of the guys that played here enjoyed doubles, so I decided to partake in it. Besides, I was getting older and doubles seemed inevitable. Additionally, I really wanted to improve my net game.</p>
<p>After playing a couple of years of doubles, my doubles game and net skills evolved tremendously. This has helped me out greatly in my singles game as well.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you play more doubles if you don’t already. Find players your level or above and enjoy the game. Trust me on this, when you play with good players, doubles is even more enjoyable than singles!</p>
<p>Within a few months of playing, even if you don’t consciously work on your volleys in practice, you should see an improvement in your net game. Doubles also helps your return game, as you need to be much more accurate with your returns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Go Easy On Yourself</h2>
<p>This one took me a lot of time to develop. By this, I mean not berating yourself for mistakes and bad play. I see a lot of club players cursing themselves, throwing their rackets and exhibiting negative body language after poorly hit shots.</p>
<p>While it may feel good for the moment to do as a stress release, in the long term it hurts you and your game. The best way to react after a poorly hit shot is to remain neutral and just observe.</p>
<p>I no longer get upset when I hit a bad shot. Instead I think of the reason why I hit that shot badly and then offer a solution to myself. It could be to get to the ball quicker next time, follow through higher or change my grip.</p>
<p>In providing a solution, I create a positive feeling in me instead of a negative one. The next time I receive the same ball, I can better make the adjustment as well.</p>
<p>You see, I look at tennis like a science. If something doesn’t work, there’s no reason to be upset. A change needs to be made. If I can make it during the match, then great.</p>
<p>If not, then I’ll need to accept me errors during the match and work to improve my technique after the match, during my practice sessions. All tantrums and bad-talking is really nothing more than overinflated egos.</p>
<p>We’re all just club players and most of the time, no money or stakes are on the line. I think players need to relax a lot more and they’ll find they play a lot better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Join A Tennis Club – Don’t Shy Away From Competition</h2>
<p>If you live in any major city or even if you don’t, there is often a tennis club somewhere in driving distance. Mine is fortunately located in my city, about 15 minutes by car.</p>
<p>If you love tennis and enjoy playing, you owe it to yourself to go down to the local tennis club and join. Many of them offer leagues where you can meet new people and players.</p>
<p>My club offers leagues for players from level 3.0 up to 5.0. This is where most club players fall in terms of level. If you’re someone who doesn’t like to lose, you have to overcome that bad trait.</p>
<p>Losing is par for the course in tennis. All tennis players lose, no matter who they are. We all have bad days. And we all face players who occasionally present bad matchups for us.</p>
<p>Believe me, it’s far better to play tennis against new and challenging players than not at all. If you lose, at least you’ll learn. There are so many levels in tennis, you could play all your life and never reach a point where you can beat everyone in your area.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to have fun, get exercise, enjoy the competition and make some new friends. In the end, none of us are competing for grand slam trophies, so wins and losses really don’t matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Underestimate Footwork</h2>
<p>I’ve said it time-and-time again, and I’ll say it one more time here: footwork is the most important aspect of tennis. If you can’t move to set up for the ball properly, your game will always be a struggle.</p>
<p>If you ask Roger Federer and Andre Agassi the same question (what is the most important aspect of tennis), they’ll both tell you footwork. Yet I see almost no club players working on it!</p>
<p>There are so many footwork drills you can practice. How about agility ladders, cones and mini hurdles? I never see players using them. Why? Because footwork is difficult to work on and hitting groundstrokes and serves is not.</p>
<p>I understand it takes a lot of work and sweat to move your feet. But tennis is a running sport and it requires excellent footwork to play at the higher levels.</p>
<p>If you underestimate the footwork required to reach the higher levels of tennis, you’ll never practice it and you’ll never improve. And that’s the bottom line on footwork. Enough said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Avoid Setting Up Late</h2>
<p>This is one that affects almost all club players. I rarely see players striking a great power position and waiting on the ball.</p>
<p>Most of the club players I see move right through their power position (or worse yet, don’t have one) and hit last second. These players tend to hit off target and often feel rushed when playing.</p>
<p>I once saw my buddy, Mike (a 4.5 level player), hitting with a female coach who was ranked inside the top 200 in the world a few years earlier. She was setting up to hit the ball when it crossed the net.</p>
<p>Mike didn’t set up until the ball landed – which was usually beyond the service line. Who do you think hit better?</p>
<p>I learned years ago that early preparation is best in tennis. If you can prepare early, you can slow down the game and play more at your pace.</p>
<p>This is a lesson that a lot of club players struggle with. I’ve tried to teach this to 3.5-4.0 level players, but most prefer to hit last second because they’re so stuck in that habit. If you can learn to set up early, you’ll see the difference it makes in your game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Be Wary Of Technical Advice From Random Players</h2>
<p>Most players like to give advice on how you should play. They’ll tell you that your grip is not correct, or you need to change your stroke in some fashion. In my experience, most players know squat about effective technique.</p>
<p>Even players that are high level and experienced have a difficult time spotting mistakes and explaining technique. For these reasons, it’s best to ignore all technical advice and focus on doing only what your coach says.</p>
<p>Personally, when someone gives me advice on my strokes, I listen and just brush it off. I know my game well enough at this point that I know what works and doesn’t.</p>
<p>But if you’re a newer player or a lower level player, just focus on doing the things your coach asks of you. If you get caught up in thinking that you need to try every piece of advice offered, it’ll drive you insane.</p>
<p>Everyone has an opinion on how you should play better. The best athletes and players in the world only listen to their coaches and themselves.</p>
<p>Sure, it can be helpful to get a tip sometimes, but if you’re an inexperienced player, how do you know what’s right and what’s not? So best to just work with a qualified coach and assess your game on your own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re like me, you probably don’t remember the very first time you started playing tennis. You’ve always played tennis and all those early matches and practice sessions blended together.</p>
<p>Or, maybe you started playing tennis a few years ago and you remember precisely how you started and how awful you were in the beginning. But now, a few years later you’re a lot better.</p>
<p>No matter which of these two scenarios best fits you, at a certain point after learning tennis and playing for a while, you reached a plateau. You had thought your game would just go up and up and up, but for some reason, it never went beyond what it is now.</p>
<p><strong>Let me give you seven ways you can overcome a tennis plateau before talking more about why it plagues almost all tennis players.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work on one shot for a prolonged time (weeks or months)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Practice placement as often as possible</strong></li>
<li><strong>Take a lesson with a qualified tennis coach</strong></li>
<li><strong>Improve your physical conditioning</strong></li>
<li><strong>Work on your mental toughness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Practice your net game religiously</strong></li>
<li><strong>Play against better players as much as possible</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite playing often, watching dozens of tennis videos on youtube and wanting to improve badly, you just have not been able to get to the next level. And you wonder if you ever will.</p>
<p>It’s been months or maybe even years and your tennis level has remained the same. So what’s going on here? When you played an instrument, the more you practiced the better you got.</p>
<p>When you draw or learn a language, the same applies. The more often you draw or speak a language, the better you got at it.</p>
<p>But you may have noticed the same philosophy doesn’t always apply to tennis. Why is that? Why aren’t you hitting harder more accurate shots after each passing week and month you play?</p>
<p>Ah, there’s a very good reason for that. Do you want to know? I’m sure you do. Okay, here’s the secret no tennis coach really wants to tell you. Despite how much you practice tennis, you’re capped by your physical and mental abilities.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Well, let’s look at the physical first. Your body only has a certain limit to how fast it can move or how explosive it can be. Even with ideal technique, you’ll be limited by the physical capabilities of your body.</p>
<p>Some of you are in your 40s and beyond. Your movements are going to be slower and less explosive than players in their 20s. It’s just a fact of nature.</p>
<p>I think most people underestimate how much athleticism plays a part in tennis. It’s not only athleticism it’s also hand-eye coordination and focus.</p>
<p>When you look at the professional players on the ATP and WTA tours, they have fantastic physical gifts. They move fast and their muscles are super explosive. They combine those gifts with near-perfect technique to produce ungodly shots.</p>
<p>If you lack their speed and explosion, you’ll never serve 120 mph or run around the court with the speed of Novak Djokovic. But the good news is you don’t have to at the club level. You can use other ways to improve your game, like tactics, placement, and better mental toughness, which we’ll get into in more detail soon.</p>
<p>The mental side of tennis is a whole other ball of wax from the physical. To break a tennis plateau requires a certain degree of mental toughness and fortitude. In my opinion as a player and coach, I believe 90% of club players or more lack it.</p>
<p>I see the same players year-after-year playing at the same level. All of them have reached a plateau. As a matter of fact, in the 12 years I’ve been playing at the same club, not one of them has broken through to the highest flight, where I play.</p>
<p>Let’s get into the seven ways you can break a tennis plateau. I am sure they will help you if you’ve been struggling for some time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Work On One Shot For A Prolonged Time</h2>
<p>Why only one shot? Why not work on two, three or four shots for a prolonged time? It’s because we can hyper-focus on that one particular shot we need to improve the most.</p>
<p>You know the old cliché, “you’re only as good as your weakest link.” Well in tennis it’s kind of the same. If you have great groundstrokes but an awful serve, you’ll lose tons of points on your serve and never progress very far.</p>
<p>Or maybe you have an all-around solid game except your backhand is horrible. If so, your opponents will notice that and key in on it to exploit it.</p>
<p>For that reason, it’s important to immediately go to work on developing our worst shot. For me that would be the second serve.</p>
<p>While I can hit hard second serves (85 mph +) with some spin, they are not as consistent as I want them to be. At the 4.5-5.0 level, they are rarely exploited. But I know at the higher levels they will be.</p>
<p>It would, therefore, serve me to work on practicing just the second serve for say a month. I would do this by practicing the second serve only for 45-60 minutes per practice session. Ideally, I would practice three times per week or every other day.</p>
<p>If you have the time and inclination, you can practice every day, and in extreme cases, twice a day. After practicing your weakest shot only for several weeks, you should see a huge improvement.</p>
<p>When playing matches, you should also experience that improvement. That will translate into greater confidence, better play and more match wins. Congratulations, you just made it to the next level up and broke through your long-standing plateau.</p>

<h2>Practice Placement As Often As Possible</h2>
<p>Some of us are endowed with the ability to hit very hard groundstrokes. If that’s you, great. But most of us can’t hit laser forehands like Federer or rocketing backhands like Stan Wawrinka.</p>
<p>To be frank, we’ll probably never develop the technique or physical ability to hit balls that hard in tennis. Additionally, we’ll never serve harder than 100 mph. So how do we offset those weaknesses and get up to the next level?</p>
<p>The answer is placement. A wise coach only told me tennis is 80% placement. It’s not always how hard you hit the ball, but how well you place it. A well-placed groundstroke at 50 mph can often win a point better than a 75-mph ball hit to the opponent. It’s the same deal with the serve.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to hit harder or with more spin, we need to practice placing the ball better to get to the next level. To do this, set up targets on the court and work at trying to hit them.</p>
<p>Do this for your serve first. The three targets you should aim for are out wide, into the body and up the T. For groundstrokes, practice hitting near the corners. If you can hit groundstrokes at tight angles, you can get your opponent off the court and finish the points a lot easier.</p>
<p>You can also do the same with volleys and overheads, aiming for angling the ball off the court. Don’t focus on hitting with more power or spin. Simply practice placement.</p>
<p>After several weeks to months or placement practice, you should notice a huge difference in your matches. You’ll be winning more matches with less effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Take A Lesson With A Qualified Tennis Coach</h2>
<p>Others can see what you can’t see in yourself. But not just any person – a qualified or certified tennis coach. You need someone with a trained eye to spot the flaws in your game and correct them.</p>
<p>Yes, a private tennis lesson can be expensive (typically $40-$60). But if you love tennis, play often and have been struggling for a long time, one tennis lesson can make a tremendous difference.</p>
<p>Why? Because just one tip can make a ton of difference. I’ll give you an example. Recently another coach I work with named Luke offered to take a look at my serve.</p>
<p>He asked me to take a few first serves. I did and he observed from the side. He then took out his phone and squatted near the ground to video my feet. He then asked me to serve a few more times.</p>
<p>I did and he recorded only my feet. He then replayed the video to me and pointed out two big flaws I had. One was that I moved my lead foot around excessively. The second, and biggest flaw was that I was not jumping off the ground nearly enough.</p>
<p>Luke told me I needed to bend my knees more and explode up into the ball. I told him I was concerned about my racket drop and some other technical things. He told me not to worry about it and just focus on bending my knees and exploding up.</p>
<p>I tried and at first, it felt difficult. But after practicing several times, I got more used to bending my knees further and jumping higher. My timing improved the more I practiced.</p>
<p>Within just a week of that tip, I added 5-10 mph on my serve and at least several of the guys I routinely play with said my serve got a lot better. Serves that were hitting the middle of the box were now landing close to the line.</p>
<p>In a singles match I played yesterday, I hit three aces in one game and had over 15 aces in the match, which is nearly a record for me.</p>
<p>There’s not much more talk about for this tip. Ask around and find a very good coach. Have them give you a few tips for each of your shots and then remember them and work on it.</p>
<p>If you can afford several or more lessons, go for it. Small improvements in technique can translate to big differences in your matches.</p>

<h2>Improve Your Physical Conditioning</h2>
<p>This one is really a no-brainer. I think every long-time tennis player knows that they should improve their physical conditioning. Better conditioning means you can get to more balls, wear out your opponent and maintain good technique in long matches.</p>
<p>What prevents most club tennis players from doing so is lack of time, injuries and age. It also comes down to a desire to improve physical conditioning.</p>
<p>When young, we can play tennis all day long and still go to the gym. But as we age into our late 30s, 40s and beyond, it’s not so easy. We also have more responsibilities and less time.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only real chance we have to improve our conditioning is when we play. If we play a couple of times per week, that’s generally not enough to make a big improvement.</p>
<p>So what’s the solution? How can we drastically improve our physical conditioning for tennis in a short period of time? If you’re able-bodied and your joints are in good health, the answer may be found in sprinting!</p>
<p>Why sprinting? Because sprinting takes a lot less time than jogging and it’s even more effective at improving physical conditioning. It also mimics the start and stop runs of tennis better than a slow, long jog.</p>
<p>The good thing is that you only need to sprint twice a week to see a noticeable improvement. But you need to be consistent with your sprinting. If you let a week or two go between sessions, you’ll lose conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>Each sprinting session only requires about 15-20 minutes to complete. You can sprint on a track (preferred), in the street or a sidewalk, or on a treadmill. Here is how I do it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warm up for five minutes with fast walking or light jogging.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Once warmed up, you’ll do 5-10 sprints of approximately 50-60 meters. You can start with 5 sprints and work up to 10 as your conditioning improves.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Get down into a sprinters stance and then explode from that position into a full sprint until you reach the 50-60 meter mark.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Once you complete the first sprint, don’t stop. Walk for 30-45 seconds and then get down into a sprinter’s stance again and repeat another sprint.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keep repeating this process until 5-10 sprints are accomplished. You should walk or light jog the final 5 minutes to cool down.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each sprint will only last 6-10 seconds, depending on your speed. It’s very important you DO NOT sprint 100% speed in your first 1-2 or even three sessions. You can pull or strain a muscle doing so.</p>
<p>This is especially true if you don’t normally play other sports or ever run full speed. Instead, start your first sprint session at 60-70% of max speed. Assess how sore you are the next day. If very sore, repeat the sprint session at 60-70%.</p>
<p>Once you are no longer very sore, you can move up to 80% of max speed. Repeat the process, assessing your level of soreness until you get up to 100%. I usually require at least two sprint sessions before I allow myself to go 100% speed.</p>
<p>Try this program out for yourself. You’ll notice a huge difference in your conditioning on court after 3-4 weeks on the program. You should also experience a slight increase in your top speed, maybe as much as 1-2 mph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Improve Mental Toughness</h2>
<p>This one is also a no-brainer for me. And it requires no physical effort whatsoever. If you simply improve your mental outlook, your tennis game will improve for sure.</p>
<p>How can I be sure? Because I’ve personally experienced both sides. I used to be very negative and berate myself after bad shots. Often I would chew myself out over easy misses and constantly frame my tennis in a negative light.</p>
<p>But after years of playing and reading Brad Gilbert’s awesome book “Winning Ugly”, I changed my approach. I started to be more understanding with myself when I made errors. I realized I was always trying to do my best, so my errors were caused mostly from poor technique and lack of skill more than anything.</p>
<p>Instead of saying things like, “you suck” or “what a lousy player I am”, I began to not say those things. In their place, I would think something like, “I need to improve my technique on that shot in order not to miss in the future. It’s a technique and practice problem – nothing more”.</p>
<p>I would then practice that shot and the next time I was faced with it in a match, I would often make the shot. I would then commend myself saying, “See, I was right. With practice, I turned that liability into a strength.”</p>
<p>I know that sounds idealistic, but I really do think like that. When I’m in a close match, I tell myself the match is mine and I visualize myself winning. These mental tactics really do work.</p>
<p>I can’t promise you they’ll work all the time because they don’t. But they sway the odds in your favor. At the least, you need to stop being hard on yourself when you miss.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to throw your racket, have a tantrum or give up on tennis. I know how it is. Instead, channel your anger and frustration into promising yourself you’ll work to improve.</p>
<p>Even if you practice all the time and still miss shots, you shouldn’t get on yourself. Look, tennis is a science. If you’re missing, there’s a valid scientific reason for it. You need to figure out that reason and correct it. There’s no use in berating yourself, which only makes things worse.</p>
<p>If you can follow these tips and improve your mental game, I promise you’ll not only see a difference in the number of matches you win, but you’ll feel better about yourself as well.</p>
<p>It’s just not healthy in any way to turn anger inwards over missing tennis shots. Leave that for John McEnroe. He’s the only one who can thrive off that kind of tactic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Practice Your Net Game Religiously</h2>
<p>Most club players don’t like being at the net. It’s kind of like trying to throw a cat in water. They’ll do everything they can to prevent it.</p>
<p>The same holds true of most club players. Put them at the net and they’ll scurry back to the safety of the baseline as soon as they can – just like a cat would scurry out of the water.</p>
<p>Why you ask? The simple reason is that most club players spend little time practicing their net game. They, therefore, feel helpless at the net. The solution is to work religiously on your net game.</p>
<p>I really like this tactic for overcoming a tennis plateau. You don’t need to hit harder, improve your serve, work on your physical conditioning, or even play more matches.</p>
<p>All you need do is practice your volleys, which typically don’t require a lot of movement – so little energy is expended. You can literally practice your volleys for hours with no fatigue.</p>
<p>Of course, you would need to practice your overheads as well. You can practice your net game with a partner, a ball machine or even on a wall.</p>
<p>I promise you, the more you practice, the quicker you’ll improve. Once you get the hang of volleying, it even becomes fun.</p>
<p>Once your volleys and overheads are adept, you can come in more during matches and knock off easy shots near the net. And if you’re playing doubles, then all the easier.</p>
<p>Believe me, getting up to net is critical for improving your tennis play. Look at Rafael Nadal. He doesn’t come to net often, but when he does, he wins 90% of the points there.</p>
<p>You should need to be strategic about when you come up. Trust me on this, if you don’t do any of the other tips in this article, do this one.</p>

<h2>Play Against Better Players As Much As Possible</h2>
<p>This is a great way to break through a tennis plateau. Here’s a perfect analogy to highlight this tip.</p>
<p>Let’s say you read at 300 words per minute. If you force yourself to read at 800 words per minute for a matter of days, you may comprehend less and feel uncomfortable doing so.</p>
<p>You may never be able to each full comprehension and comfortability reading 800 words per minute. But if you then dropped down to 400 words per minute, it would seem very slow in comparison. And there’s a good chance you would comprehend most of the words and feel comfortable there.</p>
<p>If that was true, you just made a 33% improvement in your reading speed with little or no loss of comprehension. Are you seeing where I’m going with this?</p>
<p>Let’s suppose you’re a 3.5 level player. Not a bad 3.5 or a good one, just an average 3.5 level player.</p>
<p>Now let’s pretend I set up matches for you for the next three weeks against players rated no less than 5.0 level. At first, you might lose 6-0, 6-0. But after playing against better players for a couple of weeks, something begins to happen.</p>
<p>You notice their technique and start copying it a bit. You begin to understand where and when they’ll hit the ball, maybe even reading their shots a bit better.</p>
<p>You may even develop your own little strategies for winning points here and there. After a few weeks of playing only 5.0 players, you’re still losing badly, but now you’re winning 1, 2 or 3 games each set.</p>
<p>So after three weeks, are you worse, the same, or better as a player. Clearly, you are now a better player.</p>
<p>Now imagine I match you up with a 4.0 level player who you could never beat in the past. Do you think you would have a better chance of victory now? Of course, you would. I would even put my money on you.</p>
<p>That 4.0 level player is going to be way easier to play than against the 5.0 players you were facing for three straight weeks. The balls the 4.0 level player hits now seem slow and telegraphed compared to before. You have more time to set up.</p>
<p>The little strategies you developed against the 5.0 level players are now working very well against the 4.0 level player. Additionally, the 4.0 level player is missing more, giving you more free points.</p>
<p>Do you see how this works? You can’t be afraid to face better players. Remember, tennis is a science. Except losing is a part of the game and get your butt beat as much as possible by far better players.</p>
<p>When you return to your level, the game will seem way easier. I’ve also experienced this personally in my tennis play. It’s improved my game and gotten me out of a rut several times.</p>
<p>Now, the main key to this strategy is finding better players who want to play you. Most good players don’t enjoy playing matches against players way below their level.</p>
<p>If this happens to you, you have a few options. One would be to play leagues or tournaments slightly above your level. If you’re a 4.0, try to get into tournaments for 4.5 players.</p>
<p>Another strategy is to pay better players to play you. Or at least bet them they can’t beat you. If you tell a much better player, “I bet you $20 you can’t beat me in a match,” they will be much more inclined to play you than if you offered them $20 to play you. $20 is just a suggested figure, but it could be as little as $5 or $10.</p>
<p>The last way would be if you take lessons. If so, ask the coach to play you a set in the final 15-20 minutes of the lesson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I’m sure one or more of these tennis tips will help you break through your tennis plateau. I’ve used all of them at one point or another in my tennis life.</p>
<p>The main thing is to stick with whichever option or options you choose. If you practice your net game for two weeks every day and then stop, after a few weeks your gains will diminish.</p>
<p>It’s the same thing with everything else. Consistency is key. Once you break through to the next level, you’ll be having so much fun, you’ll probably continue practicing so it won’t even be an issue.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about these tips, let me know. I don’t always have the time to clarify every little point, but I think you get the main ideas.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and drop me a comment below and let me know which tip you’ll use first.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roger Federer was once interviewed by Charlie Rose after winning the 2004 U.S. Open. In the video, he was asked why his game looked so graceful. Without hesitation, Roger cited his footwork as the single most important factor in his game – for beauty and effect.</p>
<p>Specifically, Roger said, “The key to exploring my potential is improving my footwork…It’s always what I’ve been working on.”</p>
<p>During the interview, Roger kept coming back to footwork. In my opinion as a coach, tennis player and critic, footwork is the single most important factor in determining a player’s success in tennis.</p>
<p>I say this because it doesn’t matter how good a player’s strokes are, if his footwork is lacking, he won’t be able to place himself into position to hit effective shots. If we look at the best players on the ATP tour in today’s era (Djokovic, Federer, Nadal), they all have the best footwork in the game.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence these men have consistently dominated the game for the last 15 years either. If you want to improve your tennis game, nothing will do so faster than bettering your tennis footwork.</p>
<p>But what does tennis footwork exactly mean? We hear so much about it but it’s quite a nebulous term which is rarely clearly defined. Let’s do that now.</p>
<p><strong>I can break up footwork into four distinct stages. Each stage is important and crucial to hitting great, powerful shots. </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Attaining the optimal position &#8211; Getting to the spot where the striking of the ball takes place.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Planting of the feet &#8211; placing the body into the proper firing position.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Harnessing momentum &#8211; pushing off the ground, thrusting the torso and generating the necessary momentum to propel the arm into the swing.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Recovering &#8211; returning or moving to the best location on the court.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll go through all four stages in detail shortly. I can tell you for certain that the best players blend them seamlessly together. They do so all match long and repeat the process over and over during a point.</p>
<p>When a player can use his footwork so quickly and efficiently, often and oddly, it goes unnoticed by the casual observer. What remains is a virtuoso of perfection on the court with the final punctuating shot riveted as the last memory in the viewer’s mind – not the footwork.</p>
<p>This is the primary reason why footwork does not get talked about enough. Furthermore, not enough coaches work on it with their players.</p>
<p>By reading this entire article, you’ll know exactly what proper footwork entails and how to use it to dominate all your future matches. Your level of play or age is irrelevant. Everyone can improve their footwork if they determine to.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s get into the four stages of tennis footwork.</p>
<div class="kad-youtube-shortcode videofit"  ><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6wauVoK6N4?autoplay=0&controls=1&fs=1&modestbranding=1&theme=dark&rel=0&loop=0&showinfo=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stage 1: Attaining the Optimal Position</h2>
<p>This stage can be the most difficult of all four for beginner and intermediate players to achieve correctly. This is because most people use inefficient movement to reach the ball.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most people set up to close or far away from the ball. However, when done correctly, getting to the spot where you can strike the ball should set you up perfectly for stage 2.</p>
<p>There are only three ways to move to the ball in tennis. The first is by taking a cross-step and then shuffling (or side-stepping) to the ball. This is the most commonly used technique by players.</p>
<p>A first cross-step and shuffle is primarily done when moving laterally but can be accomplished when moving backwards and forwards as well. This is done for balls not too close or far away – but at a middle distance.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>The second is to simply shuffle to the ball. This movement is used when the ball is relatively close, like a few steps away. Shuffling is done laterally but can be executed forwards and backwards as well.</p>
<p>The third way to move to the ball is to simply run. We run when the ball is far away or we have little time to get there (like on a drop shot). Running is the quickest way to reach a ball but gives us the least amount of control when hitting.</p>
<p>If we run to the ball, it would benefit us to slow down before reaching the ball. Another important factor in helping us hit the ball (no matter which of the three methods we use) is to position the racket to the side of our body (close to the power position) before reaching the ball.</p>
<p>By doing so, we can save time and put ourselves into a better position as we reach stage 2. This is the reason why professional players rarely looked rushed when hitting shots and amateurs often do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stage 2: Planting of the Feet</h2>
<p>By virtue of stage 1, we should now be in the ideal position to hit the ball. In this stage (# 2), we stop our feet (if only for a second) and plant them to the ground.</p>
<p>Why would we do this? Because all power is generated from the ground up. It’s true for every sport and tennis is no exception. In order to use the ground, we need to have our feet firmly planted on it.</p>
<p>We then bend our knees and push off the ground to create energy for the swing. As we plant our feet we must also rotate our body what’s called the power position.</p>
<p>This is a position where our racket is back (or loaded) and our torso is turned to the side. This position creates torque and kinetic energy that can be released into the shot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many club players (especially those 4.0 and lower) fail to achieve enough torque to hit truly powerful shots. This stems from improper technique and the discomfort required in torquing the body.</p>
<p>I believe this stage is of huge importance when it comes to hitting very powerful shots. Both feet need to be planted firmly on the ground and the body torqued well past 90 degrees in the shoulders.</p>
<p>When you study pros in slow motion, you’ll see them set up in this way if they have even a second of time. When on the run, they don’t always have the time to achieve a perfect stage 2 position.</p>
<p>But they get around that by using the momentum of their run in stage 1 to generate pace. This is evident in the tremendous on-the-run passing shots of Nadal and Sampras off the forehand side. They can still manage to hit 80 mph+ passing shots on a dead run due to the momentum created in their movement to the ball.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stage 3: Harnessing Momentum</h2>
<p>At the commencement of this stage, the body and racket will have completed the setup to strike the ball. Think of stage 2 as being a loaded gun or a crossbow pulled back into the final position before being released.</p>
<p>In stage 3 we execute the forward part of the stroke. This is done initially by pushing off the ground with both feet. However, it should be noted that most of your weight will be on the back foot.</p>
<p>This is so because we want to distribute our weight from the back leg to the front leg in order to transfer our body weight into the shot. You’ll see every great player do this on every basic shot in tennis (forehand, backhand, serve and volley).</p>
<p>As the legs push off the ground, the torso begins to rotate towards the net, releasing the stored kinetic energy it achieved in stage 2. The last part of the swing happens from the arm, which more-or-less goes along for the ride.</p>
<p>The major mistake most club players make here is thinking the arm is the primary source of power when it’s the legs and torso that really do the heavy lifting. The arm should be loose and flexible, snapping forward from the momentum of the body.</p>
<p>If a player never achieves an ideal power position and pushes off from the ground, then the arm is left to do the work. This results in a labored swing and slower velocity shot. Such players can never seem to generate power no matter how hard they swing.</p>
<p>This is because the legs and torso play a huge roll in how hard the ball is struck. If the legs and torso only play a small factor in the swing, the arm must work extra hard to compensate. This approach can tire a player out over a long match and result in weak swings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stage 4: Recovering</h2>
<p>After the ball is struck and the player completes his follow through, the next and final stage is to move again. This time it’s a movement to the best location on the court to set up for the next shot.</p>
<p>Experienced players rely on their anticipation to move to the ideal spot to hit the next ball. This can mean moving in any direction and any distance, just depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Often, you’ll see a player like Djokovic (who has the best footwork in the game) immediately move to a different spot on the court after completing his follow through. He seems to always know exactly where to go.</p>
<p>This comes from years of playing. Beginner players often stand in the same position after hitting a shot or move only a couple of steps. This usually puts them out of position for the next shot in the rally.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure of where to go, a good rule of thumb is to get back to the middle of the court. In general, it’s best to play slightly in back of the baseline or inside the service line (if you come into net).</p>
<p>The movement in stage 4 is similar to the movement in stage 1. You can shuffle back, cross-step and shuffle back, or just run. The quicker you can reach the ideal position to set up for the next shot, the easier the game gets. It’s also more difficult for your opponent to cause an unforced error on your part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summing It Up</h2>
<p>Ideal footwork requires technique, anticipation, and willingness to put in the work. Most players with great footwork are constantly in motion, taking as many steps as they need to place themselves into ideal hitting position.</p>
<p>The next time you watch a professional tennis match on TV or in person, take note of the footwork of the players. Instead of watching the ball or the strokes, notice how much the feet are moving.</p>
<p>Then compare that footwork to yours – if you’ve ever videoed your play. You’ll probably notice a big difference. One of the reasons I’m better than I look on camera is my footwork.</p>

<p>While my strokes weren’t honed at a prestigious tennis academy in my formative years, I make up for a lot of deficiencies with my tennis footwork. My college coach instilled it in me early on and I’ve used it religiously throughout my playing life.</p>
<p>Due to being in great physical shape and having a light body weight (150 lbs), I can move nearly as well as most professional players, despite being in my mid-40s. I’m actually known for being a great mover (more than anything else) and dazzle people with the balls I can track down.</p>
<p>I do this by utilizing the four stages of footwork I outlined in this article. If you’ve never given much thought to tennis footwork, I hope this blog post sheds new light on it for you.</p>
<p>While this article is by no means a comprehensive guide to tennis footwork, I hope it gives you food for thought and motivates you to improve your foot movement on court.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me count the ways for this question. Roger Federer is without question the greatest role model and icon tennis has ever had. In fact, I’d go so far to say he’s the best role model in all of sports period – perhaps with LeBron James second.</p>
<p><strong>Roger is widely acclaimed as the greatest tennis player of all time. There are few who would against argue it. But seemingly there must be more to it than just great tennis for his immense popularity. Here’s why I believe Roger Federer is most people’s favorite player.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#clean">Roger has a clean image (family man)</a></li>
<li><a href="#beautiful">Roger plays a beautiful tennis game (smooth and accurate)</a></li>
<li><a href="#regal">Federer is regal, debonair, and charming</a></li>
<li><a href="#gracious">Roger Federer is gracious in victory and defeat (on and off-court)</a></li>
<li><a href="#loves">The Fed truly loves the game of tennis</a></li>
<li><a href="#generous">The Swiss Maestro is generous with charitable causes</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="hrule clearfix" style="background:#81d742; height:1px"></div>
<p>At only 37, the “Fed” has already reached legendary status with his vast trove of tennis accomplishments. To date, that includes 20 grand slam trophies and so many records that it would fill this entire post up.</p>
<p>The only glitch is that Federer has come up short against Rafael Nadal on clay. Other than that, Federer’s star has shined brighter than any other male tennis player in history.</p>
<p>One coach I know says Federer’s style is like “flowing water”. Surely, Roger has one of the prettiest games of all time, and his one-handed backhand and volleys are absolute strokes of beauty. His game matches his on and off-court persona &#8211; class personified.</p>

<h2>Roger Has A Squeaky Clean Image</h2>
</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-1973 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fed9.jpg" alt="Federer" width="400" height="318" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fed9.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fed9-300x239.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Federer is one of the most well-tempered athletes of all time. He is esteemed by his peers, the fans, analysts, and even his top rivals. The Swiss Maestro is an extremely likable person and hasn’t made one major publicity mistake in his career.</p>
<p>He always has a smile and is well-groomed and well-spoken. Federer can also speak five languages fluently, which is another reason he endears himself so well to fans around the world.</p>
<p>In an age when many sports stars are mired in controversy, Federer has managed to keep a squeaky-clean image. This has garnered him dozens of endorsement deals with the likes of companies like Rolex, Wilson, Mercedes, and Nike.</p>
<p>A rarity in sports, Federer has been able to maintain a stable family life with his loving wife, Mirka. The marriage has worked out perfectly. Mirka was a former professional tennis player too but quit early on to work as Roger’s manager.</p>
<p>You can see her seated courtside at his every match to support him. The couple now has four children and are as wholesome a family as you can find. Roger has been with Mirka since the beginning of his career.</p>
<p>It seems to me that most male tennis players are one-woman type guys. Federer is no different. He’s been loyal to Mirka since they met and I believe having the stability of her as his wife and manager has allowed him to thrive on court.</p>
<p>This is another reason why Roger Federer is so popular with tennis fans. He’s loyal, devoted to his family and always seems to do the right thing. But on top of that, he’s also the most talented tennis player to ever live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>He Has A Beautiful Tennis Game</h2>
</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1969" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fed5.jpg" alt="Federer forehand" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fed5.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fed5-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fed5-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to tennis style, perhaps no other player moves and hits the ball as gracefully as Federer. While most other players seem labored in their games, Federer makes tennis look effortless with his adept footwork.</p>
<p>I believe this is one of the reasons for Roger’s longevity. If you watch his footwork, you’ll notice its textbook. He makes the most efficient movements possible, which help to preserve his body.</p>
<p>His footwork, combined with keen anticipation, has allowed him to remain at the pinnacle of the tennis world for nearly the last two decades. Roger’s style is very pleasing to the eye and all his strokes are marvelous to watch.</p>
<p>Roger’s forehand is one of the prettiest strokes in the game. It’s also one of the most lethal. The Swiss Maestro’s serve is classic in style and his volley game is superb.</p>
<p>I love watching Roger come in and knock off volleys. Of course, his one-handed backhand is a shot of beauty too. Especially when he hits it down the line for an outright winner.</p>

Federer is unlike any other player on the tour in the way he conducts himself. He’s had that charm and charisma most of his career, but it’s become more evident upon reaching his 30s.</p>
<p>Some say Roger carries himself like royalty, but without the pomp and arrogance. You can see that in the impeccable way he dresses and how he always appears calm, organized and collected.</p>
<p>Many professional tennis players disdain the press and answer questions simply because they must. But Roger truly loves people and is very gracious with his time to reporters.</p>
<p>I’ve never watched a press conference or post-match interview with Roger and came away feeling like he’s not the greatest guy in the world. He always praises his opponents, thanks to the fans and staff, and is generally very positive.</p>
<p>There’s just something about the way Roger conducts himself at all times that is regal. It’s hard to put your finger on it, but you know it when you see it.</p>

<p>Being gracious in defeat is something expected in professional tennis, but it doesn’t happen all the time. Players scoff at each other, berate officials or blame circumstances for their losses.</p>
<p>While John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors set the bar high for most outrageous behavior on the tennis court, Federer has gone the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Yes, early on in his career, Federer had some tantrums and broke some rackets. But he quickly learned to temper his anger and accept his mistakes and losses with grace. As a result, he’s won the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award several times.</p>
<p>I personally like watching the tantrums of McEnroe but to each their own. I guess I favor players that wear their hearts on their sleeve – like Andre Agassi and even Nadal.</p>
<p>Even though Federer conducts himself with exemplary behavior on the court, he’s no stoic Pete Sampras. The Fed does pump his fist and show emotion when doing well. And that’s perfectly acceptable. I think it pumps the fans up too.</p>
<p>But no matter what happens on the court, Federer is always gracious in victory and defeat. You can see the losses really bother him, but he hides it well. His humbleness in defeat is part of the reason the fans love him, and he knows that.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Roger has been in very few disputes with the chair umpires and lines people. He almost never shows anger accept to hit a ball hard after a point. I saw him do this in one match and the fans booed a bit.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel Roger is held to an impossibly high standard by the tennis world, but he’s one of the few athletes (in any sport) who can live up to it. It’s doubtful we’ll ever see the likes of such an accomplished player on and off the court as Roger.</p>

<h2>Federer Absolutely Loves The Game Of Tennis</h2>
</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-1968 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fed4.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="550" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fed4.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fed4-218x300.jpg 218w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most endearing parts of Roger (at least to me) is his love for the game. You can see he loves tennis more than any other player on the tour. And when you’re one of the best in the world, why would you want to stop?</p>
<p>Yes, he has a family, more commitments than ever before, and his body is aging, but that hasn’t stopped Roger from continuing to compete at the highest levels of the game.</p>
<p>Only a true love of the game has allowed Roger to go on at age 37.</p>
<p>At this point, Roger is the oldest player on tour in the top 100. I personally feel like he’ll play another several years if his body holds up and he can maintain a rank inside the top 10.</p>
<p>Roger is not a self-absorbed person, but he loves the spotlight when on court. He adores the adulation of the fans and loves to put on a great show for them. It’s what he does best in life and loves the most – along with his family.</p>
<p>Roger is also a student of the game and knows all the greats of tennis past. He is particularly fond of Rod Laver and the greats that came before him, like Sampras and McEnroe.</p>
<p>While Roger is acclaimed for his talent and awesome shot-making ability, his on-court intelligence is often understated. Roger knows exactly which strategy to carry out against each opponent he plays.</p>
<p>On many occasions, he’s dazzled us with some of the most brilliant shots the game has ever seen. In my opinion, Roger will always be connected to the game of tennis, even long after his career is over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="anchor">
<p><a name="generous"></a></p>
<h2>Roger Is Generous With Charitable Causes</h2>
</div>
<p>Roger is one of the more generous tennis players when it comes to charitable causes. His Roger Federer Foundation has been particularly helpful to children in Southern Africa and Switzerland.</p>
<p>His charity has raised millions of dollars over the last decade. These funds go directly into helping impoverished children in those environments receive an education.</p>
<p>Roger is also charitable with his time, even helping long-time rival Rafael Nadal when he opened his tennis academy in Mallorca, Spain. Federer has also helped a number of people financially that never gets mentioned in the media.</p>
<p>Amongst the many charitable causes that Federer has donated to are the Make-A-Wish-Foundation, Small Steps Project, Elton John AIDs Foundation, and Humpty Dumpty Foundation. There are others as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>If Roger Federer is your favorite player in tennis, enjoy his game while he’s still on tour. I would personally love to see what he can do at age 40.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Roger’s career, I wasn’t a huge fan. But I’ve been won over and now see the brilliance of his game. His wonderful temperament has also swayed me into becoming a supporter.</p>
<p>I try to watch all Roger’s matches at the major tournaments. If I can’t watch them on TV, I watch highlights on youtube. We’re fortunate to have a player like Roger in tennis.</p>
<p>He’s truly an icon that kids can look up to as a role model. Roger’s the perfect player: grace under fire, elegant in appearance, a family man, generous, kind, and always smiling. What more could you ask for in an athlete and a person?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tennis backhand can be a difficult shot for beginners in tennis. Most players today are taught the two-handed backhand, which is the shot most professional players hit with on tour.</p>
<p>As a tennis instructor, I only teach the two-handed backhand. But this doesn’t mean the one-handed backhand doesn’t have a place. I think this is evident by looking at the career of Roger Federer.</p>
<p>Federer uses a one-handed backhand, and as of the writing of this article, has racked up 20 grand slam titles. Not bad. If the one hander was a detriment, he would have never won a single major.</p>
<p>If you’re new to tennis and wondering which way to go on your backhand – one hands or two – I can tell you both are a great choice. But only one will work better for you. And only you know.</p>
<p>If you lack power or accuracy on your backhand, chances are your mechanics and timing are at fault. If you’re using the two-hander now, and you lack power, you may consider switching to the one.</p>
<p>I hit with both the two and the one, and I can tell you that there is no comparison for me. While the two-handed backhand offers stability, control, and allows me to hit late, it really lacks the drive and effortless power of the one-handed backhand.</p>
<p>I’ve always had a natural one-handed backhand and can crank the ball when it’s in my zone. I’m getting better at hitting the high shots (balls above the shoulder). This is the major challenge for all one-handed backhand players and the reason why Rafael Nadal always beats Federer on clay.</p>
<p>I discovered that you really need to brush strongly on the ball when it’s up high. By doing so, you can generate good topspin while still hitting with pace. However, it’s tricky and takes a while to learn.</p>
<p>Your best bet for improving your backhand (one or two) is on a ball machine. I like to have the balls bounce around head height so I can practice hitting the high shots. I feel like if you can deal with the high shots in tennis, you can deal with anything.</p>
<p>By now it may be clear that I favor the one-handed backhand. It’s one of the purest shots in tennis and if executed correctly, it’s virtually effortless. I know many people struggle with their one-hander, so I want to give you some tips that really helped me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Do I Improve My Backhand For Tennis?</h2>
<p>I am only going to talk about the one hander here. I have other blog posts all about technique on the two-hander, if you’re interested.</p>
<p>First off for your one-hander, you’ll want to have an eastern backhand grip &#8211; or something very close to it. The modified eastern grip works well too. See below for more information on backhand grips.</p>
<p>When hitting the one hander, it’s very important that you establish a good power position. Take a look at the best one-handed backhand players in the game today.</p>
<p>You’ll see all of them getting into the power position before striking the ball – that is unless they have no time to set up. For that reason, I think it’s mandatory you establish a power position before hitting the ball.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>While this article is not meant to go into detail on technique, I must emphasize this part of the stroke. Look at the pictures here to see the power position for the one-handed backhand. It involves a very strong unit turn.</p>
<p>After establishing the power position, you’ll work your way into the slot position. On this part of the stroke, the racket will drop and your hand will be very close into your body. The tip of the racket should be behind you (meaning opposite side of the body) at this point.</p>
<p>I feel this is an area of the backhand where a lot of people go wrong. I see many club players failing to either drop the racket down or bring the hand in close enough to the body. A failure of either, especially the latter, will result in lost power.</p>
<p>I urge you to look at Federer’s backhand in super slow motion. You’ll first see him attain the power position. Next, he moves into the slot position. These are not difficult maneuvers to achieve. You just need to practice them.</p>
<p>Why is a good slot position so important? It’s because the racket needs maximum room to accelerate into the ball. It does that by moving away from the body and out into the ball.</p>
<p>Every groundstroke in tennis has an outside-inside-outside component. I talked about this in other blog posts. The one-handed backhand is no different.</p>
<p>This brings us to the third part of the one hand backhand, which is swing-to-contact. After reaching the slot position, you’ll swing to contact the ball.</p>
<p>Your nondominant hand will come off the racket and your dominant hand (the one with the racket) will remain perfectly straight throughout the rest of the stroke. This is crucial.</p>
<p>For some reason, people like to bend their elbow before they hit the ball or after. This will surely detract from power and accuracy. If the best one-handed players in the world don’t bend their arms throughout the whole stroke, why would you?</p>
<p>As you swing (with a fully straight arm) to hit the ball, contact should be made in front of the lead foot. Unlike the two-hander, where you can hit late, the one hander needs to be struck out in front of the body.</p>
<p>For this reason, good preparation and timing is essential for hitting the one hander. However, the benefit is more effortless power than the two-hander. Think of it like this: If you throw a frisbee, would you throw it further using one hands or two hands?</p>
<p>The answer is one, which is why frisbees are only thrown with one hand. Throwing a frisbee and hitting a one-handed backhand are similar motions. It makes sense then that the one hander can generate more power.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>The act of throwing a frisbee or hitting a one-hander is even a more natural motion than hitting a forehand. With the backhand motion, we are throwing away from our body. In the latter (the forehand) we’re throwing against or across our body.</p>
<p>I believe that the one hander provides the most powerful shot in the game of tennis, with the exception of the serve and overhead. This is because of the tremendous amount of torque created before the shot.</p>
<p>Okay, enough about biomechanics. Let’s get back to the swing-to-contact. As you make contact with the ball, your hitting hand should be almost in a punch position (see picture). Your first will be almost facing your opponent with hand, wrist, and arm all aligned straight.</p>
<p>This is another place where many club players get it wrong. I see them bending their wrist or hitting the ball too soon or too late. Look at the pictures here so you can see the correct arm position when making contact.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>After contact is made, you’ll continue the swing all the way to follow through. The best one handers on the pro tour (Dimitrov, Thiem, Wawrinka) make a complete follow through, so the bottom of their rackets end up facing their opponents at the end of the stroke.</p>
<p>This takes some flexibility. Most of you at the club level will be fine following through around 80-85% of the way (from the pros). Just make sure you finish high and your arm stays straight.</p>
<p>It’s critical to mention here that you should keep your nondominant hand back to stabilize your body. You’ll also want to keep closed (meaning stay to the side) as you hit the one hander.</p>
<p>Another common issue on the one-handed tennis backhand is opening up too soon. This means players face the court way too early when hitting the stroke. It’s important to stay to the side, as I just mentioned.</p>
<p>That’s it. Easy, right?</p>
<p>We just covered the four major points of the one-handed backhand. To recap they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>power position</li>
<li>slot position</li>
<li>swing-to-contact</li>
<li>follow through</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can put all these steps together into one nice, smooth-flowing stroke, you’ll have yourself a beautiful one-handed backhand. In time, you’ll be able to hit with power, topspin, and accuracy.</p>
<p>Remember to video yourself to make sure you’re hitting all the major positions correctly. Practice shadow swinging at home to ensure you lock them into your muscle memory. Then reinforce it on the ball machine or with a practice partner.</p>
<p>If you know somebody that can volley well, have them stand at the net and volley the ball to your backhand over-and-over. This one of the best ways to practice. You’ll hit more backhands than in rallies and learn to set up faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Who Has A One-Handed Backhand?</h2>
<p>While the one-handed backhand is waning in popularity, there are still some very successful pros in the men’s game that use it. As of 2019, here are the best one handers in the game of tennis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roger Federer</li>
<li>Dominic Thiem</li>
<li>Gregor Dimitrov</li>
<li>Stanislaw Wawrinka</li>
<li>Richard Gasquet</li>
<li>Dennis Shapovalov</li>
<li>Stefanos Tsitsipas</li>
<li>Nicolas Almagro (if he returns to action from injury)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the women’s tour, very few players use the one hander. I can only think of two players that use the one-hander who are ranked inside the top 100. Everyone else uses the two-hander. Amazing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Carla Suarez Navarro</li>
<li>Tatjana Maria</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the rest of this blog post, I’m going to answer some common questions people have about the one hander. I think you’ll find this segment interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Grip Does Roger Federer Use For Backhand?</h2>
<p>Federer uses a modified eastern backhand grip. This is where the knuckles are not sitting directly over bevel one but positioned slightly more to the second bevel. This is the same grip I use on my one-handed tennis backhand. I feel it offers maximum power with sufficient spin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Is Tennis Eastern Grip?</h2>
<p>The eastern grip, also called the eastern backhand grip, is when the knuckles of the hitting hand are positioned directly over bevel one. When hitting the backhand, bevel one is the top part of the handle.</p>
<p>This is a great grip for hitting the one handed backhand with good power and spin. It is used by many of the ATP pros who hit with one hand on their backhand.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Why Do Some Tennis Players Play A Single Handed Backhand And Some A Two-Handed Backhand?</h2>
<p>It largely depends on how players were coached when young. Almost all coaches these days teach the two-hander over the one. But back in the 1990s, when most of today’s players were learning the game, old-time coaches still preferred the one hander.</p>
<p>For this reason, they taught it to their students. The great players on tour you see today who use the one probably had such coaches. In some instances, a coach will show a young player both strokes and see which one the player hits better.</p>
<p>Some players really take to the one hander. The one-hander was more popular when serve and volley was in vogue. This is because one-handed backhand players have an easier time serving and volleying.</p>
<p>Such was the case with Pete Sampras, who started off with a good two-handed backhand, but made the switch to the one when he was around 13-14 years of age. I personally use both the one and two, but favor the one, as I find it gives a lot more power.</p>
<p>As we already saw with the woman’s game, coaches are exclusively teaching the two-hander now. With serve and volley falling out of vogue, there’s really no reason for players to hit with the one anymore.</p>

</script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why Are There So Few Tennis Players With One-Handed Backhands?</h2>
<p>The one-handed backhand was very popular in the 1960s and 70s. Popularity for the one started to wane in the 80s when better racket technology was invented. Balls were struck harder and there was less time to set up for shots.</p>
<p>The one-handed backhand requires more time to set up and more precise timing than the two-hander. For this reason, the learning curve on the two-hander is a lot shorter than the one.</p>
<p>Coaches recognized this as the game was becoming faster and more competitive. With increased racket technology, a two-hander could hit with comparable power to a one-hander. Two-handers can also take the ball later, hit the high balls easier, and have more control.</p>
<p>As a result, coaches favored the two-hander and an influx of great two-handed backhand players flooded the pro circuit in the 2000s, especially on the women’s tour. It’s now a novelty to see a female player use a one-handed backhand.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Is Wawrinka’s Backhand The Best One-Handed Backhand In Tennis History?</h2>
<p>I don’t think so. He certainly has a good one, but so do all the other players I mentioned in my list above. How can you not say Federer doesn’t have the best one hander in tennis? He’s only won 20 majors!</p>
<p>I think it all comes down to preference. All these guys can crush their one hander and can end the point in one swing. Personally speaking, I’ve always like the backhand of Nicolas Almagro. But Dominic Thiem’s backhand is amazing as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why Is The Two-Handed Backhand Preferred In Men’s Professional Tennis Today? And Why In The Women’s Game Too?</h2>
<p>For the reasons I mentioned above. There’s a much shorter learning curve with the two-hander and it offers advantages over the one-hander, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easier to return serve</li>
<li>Better able to cope with high balls</li>
<li>Ability to hit late compared to the one hander</li>
<li>More stability and control</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are still men who use the one in the pro game, but the numbers decline each passing decade. On the women’s side, the one hander is virtually extinct. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the day when all top 100 women on the WTA tour use the two-hander.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Should Kids Learn The One-Handed Backhand?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. Why not? Here’s the thing about the one-handed backhand. I’ll put it in this light, or use this metaphor. Imagine teaching a child how to paint in watercolor and in oil. The watercolor can be learned in not too long a time, but it’s a bit limited in terms of its artistic ability on canvas.</p>
<p>Learning to paint in oil is a more refined craft that takes longer to master. However, you can create more diverse art with oil, as its textured. In the end, which is better? While both are beautiful, the oil painting is simply a richer art. But there’s a price to pay for learning to paint in oil (or hit a one-hander), namely the time and practice involved.</p>
<p>The one hander still has a place in the game of tennis. The most successful players of all time have and had one-handed backhands. Here are just a few: Federer, Sampras, the Bryan brothers, and Martina Navratilova. Combined, they have over 250 titles. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>I would suggest showing a child both and asking the child which one they like more. If a child likes to practice and can put in the time, the one handed backhand is an excellent choice.</p>
<p>Yes, there will be more of a struggle in the early stages, but it will pay off down the line. I’ve seen youtube videos of 10-12 year old children hitting incredible one handers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tennis is one of the toughest sports of all the popular sports to play well. If you’re new to the game, just realize it can take months, or even years, to get to a level where you can hit and play confidently.</p>
<p>If you have a good coach from the beginning, it will make your tennis journey a lot easier. I can tell you that for sure. Take it from someone who didn’t have coaching and didn’t know proper technique in my formative tennis years.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve heard it said that tennis and golf are the only two sports you can play life-long and never improve. And I believe it. How many of you know someone that plays either sport frequently and always stays at the same level?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let me list the ways why tennis is a hard sport:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tennis requires precise timing and years of practice.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tennis utilizes technical skills often hidden without the aid of coaching.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tennis demands a high level of athleticism and coordination.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tennis calls for a strong mindset and positive attitude in the face of constant adversity.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to talk in more detail about these. I believe if you can understand why tennis is hard to pick up, you’ll gain a greater appreciation for the sport. You’ll also better understand how to learn the game.</p>
<p>While some of you may view me as a high-level player, I struggled with my game for years. I didn’t learn tennis at a prestigious academy. I learned through years of trial-by-fire and analysis of the game.</p>
<p>For this reason, I believe I’m perfectly qualified to help recreational players improve their tennis games. I do this in my lessons, my blog, and my videos. I’ve been through it all in tennis and know the little nuances of why people struggle and what they can do to improve.</p>
<p>But this blog post is not about giving technical advice. It’s a post more about the journey of learning the game and answering the question I’m so often asked: “Is tennis a difficult sport to learn?” I believe it is and I my thoughts are reaffirmed every time I give a lesson to a new player.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, after Serena Williams won yet another major, I saw two women hitting on the court next to me. They clearly had never played tennis before or had minimum experience. They could barely hit the ball to each other but were inspired to play after watching Serena.</p>
<p>One of them commented, “This is harder than I thought. Serena makes it looks so easy on TV.” I thought in my mind, “If you only knew how many hours Serena put into the game to become that good, it would make you shutter.”</p>
<p>People that have never played tennis have little clue how difficult this game is. But with the right coaching and several hundred hours of practice time, a player can reach a beginner level and play entry-level competitive tennis.</p>
<p>Alright, so let’s go through each bullet point I listed above. In that way, I can clarify better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tennis Requires Precise Timing And Years Of Practice</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1934" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/time2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/time2.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/time2-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/time2-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first started playing tennis, I rarely hit the ball cleanly. It was only after a couple of years of constantly playing that I learned what it meant to hit the ball on the sweet spot of the racket consistently.</p>
<p>I believe one of the biggest reasons why people don’t succeed early on is a lack of precision in their game. If you can’t hit the ball on the sweet spot, chances are you’ll never excel in tennis.</p>
<p>This only comes through countless hours on the court, learning to time the ball. I find that kids and uncoordinated adults have the hardest time with this. They often hit the ball too early, too late, or near the frame.</p>
<p>It’s a real problem and one not easily solved. To time your swing to hit the ball at the perfect moment is not an easy feat. Sure, the pros make it look easy. But if you’re a beginner tennis player, you know it’s not.</p>
<p>Even after more than 20 years of playing, I still struggle with this on various shots. Most of them are shots taken right off the ground or ones with heavy topspin that raise up high.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />

</script></p>
<p>Another area where timing is crucial is the serve. If you want to play a match, you need to learn the tennis serve. I’ve written numerous articles on the serve and why it’s one of the toughest shots in tennis to master.</p>
<p>The serve requires absolutely perfect timing and years of practice to master. Unlike most other sports, the margin of error for this shot is extremely low. Yes, sports like golf and baseball are somewhat similar, but tennis requires precise timing in everything.</p>
<p>When I give lessons, the serve is really where the rubber meets the road. I can quickly tell how adept a player will be. Most struggle with the serve heavily, while others can pick it up at a decent pace. But a strong, advanced serve takes years of learning and good coordination.</p>
<p>The other areas of tennis that require precision timing are the volleys and overheads. These shots often perplex beginners, especially the overhead. But like all the other shots, with practice, they slowly begin to improve.</p>
<p>The volley is perhaps the easiest shot in tennis to hit. It’s a very short, compact motion that anyone can learn. Unfortunately, if the timing is not perfect on it, the volley usually fails.</p>
<p>When a ball is coming 80 mph directly at your body, even players with a great volley can miss. This is what makes tennis so difficult. You can never really predict where the ball is going to be due to factors such as wind and court surface. When playing on clay, it’s like a crapshoot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tennis Utilizes Technical Skills Often Hidden Without The Aid Of Coaching</h2>
<div id="attachment_1944" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1944" class="size-full wp-image-1944" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/coachandkid.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/coachandkid.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/coachandkid-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/coachandkid-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1944" class="wp-caption-text">Carine06 from UK [<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0">CC BY-SA 2.0</a>], <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kyle_Edmund_%26_coach_trainer_(8338509649).jpg">via Wikimedia Commons</a></p></div>
<p>I played a lot of sports growing up and I was able to get good at most of them. But the one sport I couldn’t get good at was tennis. This is because it requires a special set of skills oblivious to the new or untrained player.</p>
<p>When I played baseball, the most difficult thing to do was to hit the ball. I did that okay but throwing and running came naturally. In football, all I had to do was catch and run. In basketball, I taught myself to shoot very well and dribble efficiently. It wasn’t very difficult if I practiced enough.</p>
<p>As I got into tennis in my late teens, I noticed my level improved only very gradually. It was almost imperceptible. I played for several hours every day for 4-5 years and saw almost no improvement. It was the one sport I couldn’t figure out.</p>
<p>And that’s because every stroke in tennis involves a unique set of technical skills. If you don’t do the stroke correctly, you end up with what I call a “homemade” stroke that will never compare to hitting the ball with proper technique.</p>
<p>Just watch a recreational player hit the ball and you’ll see a massive difference between them and a pro. Have you ever noticed that? Why is there so much of a difference?</p>
<p>The pro has been taught correct technique and honed it over years of play. The result is a vastly better shot. It’s also a vastly different-looking shot. It’s very evident when comparing a recreational player to a pro.</p>
<p>But when you look at most other sports, there doesn’t appear to be much of a difference between an amateur and a pro. Good examples of this include football, soccer, and basketball. You can go to a recreational game of these sports and the players don’t look that much different from pros if they have experience.</p>
<p>But tennis is different. It’s just a hard sport to learn if you don’t have proper coaching. But with proper coaching, it can be picked up in a year or two with continuous practice.</p>
<p>I’ve seen the difference in coached players and non-coached tennis players &#8211; the difference is stark. If you’re new to tennis and want to improve fast, the best bet is to hire a qualified coach.</p>
<p>If you can’t afford one, take an online tennis course or watch free tennis videos. Trust me, knowing proper technique makes all the difference. It always surprises me when experienced club players make the same glaring flaws in their technique year-after-year.</p>

<h2>Tennis Demands A High Level Of Athleticism And Coordination</h2>
<div id="attachment_1938" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1938" class="size-full wp-image-1938" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DjokovicAthleticism.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DjokovicAthleticism.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DjokovicAthleticism-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DjokovicAthleticism-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1938" class="wp-caption-text"><a title="Novak Djokovic" href="https://flickr.com/photos/43555660@N00/8155421947">&#8220;Novak Djokovic&#8221;</a> by <a href="https://flickr.com/people/43555660@N00">Carine06</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA</a></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While almost all sports require a high level of athleticism, it’s especially true in tennis. Being a great athlete is a must if you want to make it to the higher levels of tennis, such as being a Division I college player, advanced level tournament player, or professional tour level player.</p>
<p>If you look at the best players in the sport – Nadal, Federer, Serena – they all have one thing in common: being exceptional athletes. Tennis requires perfect footwork, quick starts and stops, and explosive movements. It also requires superb endurance, as matches could go on for hours.</p>
<p>One of the reasons recreational players fail to advance in tennis is a lack of athleticism. They just can’t move their bodies quick enough to hit a hard groundstroke or penetrating tennis serve.</p>
<p>I see this with my own students. Many of the older ones have trouble generating sufficient racket speed. They also lack the explosion necessary to move to a ball hit away from them and return to a good court position.</p>
<p>I’m afraid not much can be done to improve the athleticism of a 60-year-old woman or man looking to improve their game. For this reason, your level in tennis will largely be determined by your athletic prowess or lack thereof.</p>
<p>In cases like these, working on improved technique is paramount. Just by improving technique, a player can jump up a level without working on any athletic prowess. But movement is key in tennis, so it will be a small level up.</p>
<p>Tennis also requires a high degree of coordination. If you can’t coordinate all the pieces correctly, the kinetic chain breaks down. This will result in poorly hit shots and serves.</p>
<p>When I teach players – especially to new students – I can often spot 5-6 things they need to improve on for each stroke. For example, when teaching the forehand, the mistakes are evident and one seems to affect the other.</p>
<p>They could be lack of power position, not achieving a laid-back wrist, not extending out to hit the ball, lack of follow through and rotation in the body, and hitting late. These are just some examples.</p>
<p>I need to correct all these mistakes for my student to hit a great tennis forehand. But where to begin? Many adult students come to me with bad habits, which is why I like teaching children.</p>
<p>Children are like blank slates. You can show them the proper technique from the beginning and they don’t know anything different. That’s why all the professional players in the world learn tennis when young. Not one of them learned on their own or came to the game as an adult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tennis Calls For A Strong Mindset And Positive Attitude</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1946" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/palash-jain-1185010-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/palash-jain-1185010-unsplash.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/palash-jain-1185010-unsplash-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/palash-jain-1185010-unsplash-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike most other sports, tennis is a one-on-one battle that can drive you to insanity. That is unless you like to play doubles. I personally enjoy both singles and doubles.</p>
<p>In either play, tennis requires a stronger mindset to succeed than most other sports. Among the four major team sports in the U.S. (basketball, baseball, football, and hockey), there are at least four other teammates to rely on. And in football, there are 10!</p>
<p>In these sports, it’s perfectly fine to play a role and allow your teammates to do the rest. I’ll give you an example. In football, the kicker only plays in certain situations, such as when kicking field goals, punts, etc. But the entire rest of the game is dictated by all the other players.</p>
<p>In tennis, you’re responsible for everything that happens on the court. It, therefore, requires a strong mindset, as there are a lot of ups and downs that occur in a match. You’re on the court 100% of the time and all eyes are on you.</p>
<p>Just watch a professional tennis match to see evidence of it. There are so many ups and downs that are possible. During one point a player can be jubilant and the next one point he could be sulking.</p>
<p>I’ve seen so many matches where a player could have easily won, but their mind got the best of them. In one recent match, Sloan Stephens was playing a lower ranked Russian player named Ekaterina Alexandrova. In the first set, Stephens got starched, losing 6-0. That was a shock to everyone.</p>
<p>Alexandrova was up a break in the second set and serving for the match at 5-3. But out of the blue and for seemingly no reason, she began to fall apart. She exacerbated her problems with severe negative body language where it wasn’t necessary.</p>
<p>Instead of remaining poised and strong, every shot she missed would draw a noticeable sigh and shaking of her head. Sloan noticed her dismay and stayed the course. She eventually won the second set in a tie-breaker and took the match in a third set tie-breaker.</p>
<p>The only other sport that rivals tennis for mindset is combat fighting, like boxing or MMA. In those sports, mindset is very important. But even fighters with the best mindsets can be defeated in a single blow.</p>
<p>Tennis is a bit different in that a player always needs to win at least 12 games before the match is over. This can take anywhere from 45 minutes (if a very decisive victory) to several hours or more. A tennis player, therefore, needs to remain mentally strong and focused for hours at a time.</p>
<p>Any lapse in mental fortitude can result in losing the match. It took me a while to hone my mental attitude to where it is today. But beginners often become too despondent when they miss or lose.</p>
<p>For this reason, tennis is a hard sport to get good at. It definitely requires mental strength, as well as physical abilities.</p>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>As you can see, tennis is not an easy sport to learn. It requires a lot of time and practice to get good at. Unfortunately, it often involves a good deal of money to get good at as well.</p>
<p>I hope this post answers some questions you had about tennis. Please don’t let me discourage you from playing though. I know some of the things I said here make tennis seem difficult.</p>
<p>I admit tennis is a difficult sport to learn, but you’ll never know how good you can be until you try it out. So take to the court, learn proper technique, and have low expectations in the beginning. That’s your best route to success in tennis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been playing tennis for 25 years and I can tell you it does cost money to play. But it may surprise you how little it can cost in the right locations.</p>
<p><strong>The cost to play tennis varies depending on your location and several other factors. If you’re curious to know if tennis only a rich man’s sport, this post will spell it all out for you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tennis is like anything else in life. The more money you spend, the better quality you get. If you’re stretched for money though, I’ll show you a few ways to play tennis on the cheap.</strong></p>
<p>I already said location is a factor in cost. Here are some other factors that will influence your tennis budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tennis gear</li>
<li>Court time</li>
<li>Coaching</li>
<li>Tournaments and leagues</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike basketball or soccer, where you can just show up and play for free, tennis usually requires money to play. This is because of the factors I just mentioned.</p>
<p>But tennis need not break your budget. In this article, I’ll explain how you can keep your tennis costs low. For those who have the money to spend, I’ll discuss how you can create an awesome tennis lifestyle and really take your game to the next level.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s get into it, starting with location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cost Depending On Location</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1942" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/piggybank.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/piggybank.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/piggybank-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/piggybank-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, location is one of the most important factors to influence the amount of money you spend on tennis. I’ll give you an example from my life.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in New York. In the summertime, outdoor public and private courts are available. Some public courts were free but most required small fees ($5-$8 per hour per person). I was glad to pay those fees to play in the warm months.</p>
<p>But when the cold months come, tennis outdoors is virtually out the window. Nobody likes to play in 30-degree weather with snow on the ground – although I did it a few times.</p>
<p>The only option at that point is to play indoors. We called indoor courts “tennis bubbles”. The cost for indoor courts is considerably more than outdoor courts. The costs for indoor courts usually range from $40-$100 per hour per person!</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>If you live in a cold-weather state or country, indoor courts are your only option. If you play three times per week for one hour each day, at an average cost of $50 per hour, you’re looking at $600 per month.</p>
<p>That’s not cheap. And that doesn’t include the tennis gear and possible coaching. When I was living in New York, some of the indoor tennis courts offered deals where you could buy a seasonal membership.</p>
<p>In one club where I bought a membership, it allowed me to play any time the courts weren’t booked. In another club, I could only book court time during certain hours.</p>
<p>If you like to play a lot of tennis and your schedule is flexible, ask your local indoor tennis club if they have seasonal memberships. This is by far the cheapest way to go. Try to avoid peak hours, where the rates are sky high.</p>
<p>So that was life in New York. On average, I’d spend around $20-$30 per week during the outdoor season on court time and approximately $100 per month for indoor court time in the cold season.</p>
<p>But that was over 20 years ago, in the mid-‘90s. It’s probably more now. I also got great deals on indoor courts due to playing on the local college tennis team.</p>
<p>If you live in a cold-weather state, plan to spend at least several hundred dollars per month if you want to play a couple of hours per week. There’s really no getting around the cost of indoor court time.</p>
<p>In January of 2007, I moved to sunny South Florida. A lot of my decision had to do with the tennis down here. First, there are no indoor courts; all courts are outside and there is an abundance of them. This dramatically lowered my cost of playing tennis alone.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>Tennis can be played outdoors here year-round, with average temperatures in the 70s during the winter months. Second, there are more players here and the tennis is better than New York.</p>
<p>Currently, I spend zero money on court time. This is because I have private tennis courts in my community. Now you may be lucky and have that in your community as well. If so, it really cuts down on the cost of tennis.</p>
<p>One of my clients, an esteemed gentleman who compensates me nicely to hit with him, pays for my membership to a private club. This club has 8 har-true tennis courts. Additionally, I have a ton of tennis buddies who have access to tennis courts all around the area, so playing here in Florida is very cheap.</p>
<p>If you’re serious about tennis, moving to a warm climate will decrease your tennis costs substantially. You’ll also find more players to hit with, be able to play more often, and enjoy life more. No, seriously. Warm climates are awesome!</p>
<p>Some of you may live in remote locations where tennis courts are far. In that case, you’ll need to drive quite a distance, which requires gas money and time.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that your location will largely dictate how much you spend on tennis. In the best of cases, like mine, tennis will be virtually free. In the worst case, and if you’re an avid player, you could spend as much as $1000 per month on indoor court time in cold-weather areas and months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Much Does Tennis Gear Cost?</h2>
<p>Tennis gear isn’t cheap. But it need not break your budget. Below is a list of the necessary tennis gear you’ll need when you start playing. As you get better, you may add more items to the list, but these are the bare essentials.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tennis sneakers</li>
<li>Tennis shorts, shirt, and hat (optional)</li>
<li>Rackets</li>
<li>String</li>
<li>Balls</li>
<li>Tennis bag</li>
<li>Grips</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most expensive cost will be your tennis rackets. Now, you could go out and buy a $10 racket off eBay, but I’m assuming you’ll want to buy a new racket of good quality. Any decent adult tennis racket is going to cost you at least $100.</p>
<p>You’ll need at minimum two rackets but having three is optimal. The reason is that strings break unexpectedly. If you have only two rackets and the strings go on one, now you have just one racket left. That’s why I always carry three rackets in my tennis bag.</p>
<p>The next most expensive item will be your tennis sneakers. These can range from $40 up to over $100. The type I buy (Addidas Barricade) costs around $65. While you can practically wear any sneaker on court, tennis sneakers are best because they give you the best traction and ankle support of any kind of sneaker for tennis.</p>
<p>Next up is tennis apparel, which I put as optional. You can wear any sports related garb you want on court, but if you want to look and feel the part, you’ll want to purchase tennis shorts, shirt, and hat.</p>
<p>Tennis apparel is not cheap. But if you have the budget and are fashion conscious, spend the money to get yourself some good-looking clothing. Most tennis apparel is light, colorful, and made for tennis. If you don’t buy tennis shorts, always use shorts or pants with pockets. You’ll need pockets to hold the balls.</p>
<p>String can be another big expense, but only if you buy it in bulk. I usually spend about $100 on buying bulk string every three months. But I play often. When you break the strings on your racket, you’ll need to either restring the racket yourself or bring it to a professional stringer.</p>
<p>Most professional tennis stringers charge a minimum of $20-$25 for their labor and string. This usually involves cheap string. If you want a higher quality string, you’ll need to spend upwards of $35, maybe even $40 or $45. This is for one racket.</p>

<p>It’s actually cheaper to buy string in bulk and give it to the stringer every time you string a racket. That’s what I do. I buy the string from Amazon and then hand it to my stringer, who charges me $15 per racket. In total, I pay around $25 per racket (for labor and string) when all is said and done.</p>
<p>How often will you string your racket? That totally depends on how much you play and your level of play. I know people that restring only a couple of times per year. I also know people that restring every week.</p>
<p>The one cost you can’t skimp on is balls. Playing with dead balls is no fun. So you’ll want to open a new can of tennis balls each time you play a match. If you’re just practicing, used balls can work fine.</p>
<p>The cost for balls ranges in price from $2.50 per can up to about $4. When you play tennis with friends, it’s customary for you to alter opening a new can. For example, if I play tennis Monday with Gary, I’ll open a new can. When we play again on Thursday, it’s his turn to open a new can.</p>
<p>The cost for balls isn’t exorbitant. It’s just an expense you’ll need to continually pay, unlike when you buy a racket and you’re good for several years. Figure on spending $10 per month for balls on the low side, and up to $30-$40 per month on the high side.</p>
<p>The tennis bag is essential. I see some people show up with a backpack or some other contraption and it looks awful. If you don’t have a tennis bag, do yourself a favor and buy one if you play tennis consistently. It’s a one-time expense for the most part.</p>
<p>A tennis bag is made to carry rackets and all your equipment. Not just that, but it makes you look like a real player and it’s very practical. New tennis bags usually start around $40. If you’re on a budget, you can probably buy a cheap, used tennis bag on e-bay for $10 or so.</p>
<p>The last piece of tennis gear I&#8217;ll mention is grips. Grips are fairly cheap, at about $2 each. A grip will last you on average 5-10 hours of play. It really depends on how warm it is when you play, how much you sweat, and how aggressively you grip the racket.</p>
<p>I like to buy the 12-pack of Wilson Tennis Overgrips. I find them to be comfortable and really absorb sweat well. It’s always best to have more grips than less.</p>
<p>Most people underestimate the importance of grips, but they can vastly improve your strokes. Ever try playing with a ratty, frayed grip on a hot humid day? If you have, you know what I’m talking about.</p>

<h2>How Much Does Coaching Cost?</h2>
<p>If you’re new to tennis, I recommend getting coaching, at least in the beginning. Tennis is a lot more fun when you know proper technique. I’ll go over the cost of coaching here, plus a few other alternatives for those more budget-minded.</p>
<p>If you’re an experienced player, you can probably skip the coaching if you enjoy playing at your level. Still, it never hurts to take a lesson from a qualified tennis coach to up your game. Even Roger Federer has a coach!</p>
<p>The fastest way to learn tennis is through private coaching. Private coaching rates vary by location and coach. Figure on paying $30 on the low side, and $100 or more for the very best coaches. In my opinion, $60 per hour should get you an excellent coach.</p>
<p>If you take a lesson once a week from a $60 per hour coach, your costs per month will be $240. As a beginner, you will likely need coaching for several months to get up to speed.</p>
<p>A cheaper alternative is to do group lessons or join a clinic. You won’t get the one-on-one attention that a private coaching lesson affords, but it’s your next best option.</p>
<p>For example, you could ask a private coach to teach you and one or two other friends at the same time. This would cut the cost down considerably. It might also make the lesson more fun with your friends involved.</p>
<p>On the other hand, clinics can range from several people up to a dozen. The costs vary depending on group size and duration. Most clinics I know charge $15-$20 per person. Most clinics are more for practice than technique though, so it’s a good option if you already know proper technique.</p>
<p>The next alternative option is an on-line course. Courses can range in price from around $20 up to $100, depending on the instructor and what the course involves. These courses will show you step-by-step how to hit each tennis stroke.</p>
<p>These tennis courses are great in that you have the lesson right there in video any time you want. However, there’s one huge drawback when compared to private coaching: there’s nobody there to watch and correct your strokes.</p>
<p>For this reason, you’ll need to video your strokes and compare them to the video lesson. Or, you can send your video to a qualified coach to critique. It will cost you, but it’s a lot cheaper to go this route than regular private coaching lessons.</p>
<p>The last option is to watch free tennis videos on youtube. I have a lot of great tennis tutorial videos on my youtube channel if you need help with your game. I have videos on the backhand, forehand, serve, volleys, and footwork.</p>

<h2>Costs Of Tournaments And Leagues</h2>
<p>If you’re a competitive player and know the fundamentals of tennis, you may consider joining a tennis tournament or tennis league. What’s the difference you may ask? And how much does each cost?</p>
<p>A tennis tournament is a one-time event that is usually played on the weekend. Many tournaments are a one-and-done event, meaning if you lose, you don’t play another matche.</p>
<p>The USTA is the best place to look for local tennis tournaments. As of 2019, it costs $44 per year for an adult membership. As a member, you’ll be able to enter local tournaments at your level.</p>
<p>The average USTA tournaments costs $50 to enter. The cost covers court time, balls, and lights (if necessary). It’s not a bad deal and it will give you good experience. The drawback is that it can become costly if you enter tournaments every weekend and need to drive far to get to them.</p>
<p>That’s why I prefer to join tennis leagues. These are usually offered by your local tennis club (if you have one). In my area, I have a club about 10 miles from my home. The club offers singles and doubles leagues every week.</p>
<p>The cost for joining the league is $46 and includes court time, balls, lights, and 7 guaranteed matches. It’s quite a deal, I know. But then again, this is South Florida.</p>
<p>The leagues are a lot of fun because you usually play with the same people year-after-year and make good friends. My league has five flights with 8 people per flight. The line-up in each flight changes slightly after each season ends (a season is 8 matches).</p>
<p>If you enjoy tennis and have a tennis club near you, call them and ask if they offer leagues. To me, they’re far better than tournaments and a lot cheaper.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re goal is to make it to the higher levels of tennis (past 5.0 level), than you’ll want to play tournaments. If I wanted to see how high I can go in tennis, I’d start playing open tournaments all throughout Florida.</p>
<p>But due to my coaching and work schedule, it’s not practical. But if you’re young, hungry for success, and have great talent, tournaments are the only way to go. By playing tournaments you can rank state-wide, nationally, and even gain a world ranking. Oh, if only I could have been ranked 758 in the world. My life would be so much better now (LOL).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summing It Up</h2>
<p>If you’ve read this far, you now have a good idea of the costs associated with tennis. Just know, it’s entirely possible to play tennis year-round for free. I know a guy near me who plays virtually for free.</p>
<p>His name is Drew and he’s a very talented club player (5.0 level). He’s so good, that other players don’t mind paying for his court time and the balls. Drew just shows up and plays whenever he’s asked. The only tennis expense Drew has are for strings, grips, and a change of sneakers a couple of times per year.</p>
<p>This is an extreme example. On the high side, if you want to play at prestigious tennis clubs, take lessons from the best pros, and have awesome new gear, you can easily spend $15,000-$25,000 per year on tennis.</p>
<p>I didn’t mention it earlier, but if you’re a parent who has a child who wants to excel in tennis, you’ll need to pay for private lessons (or group lessons at least). In that case, budget several thousand dollars per year for 1-2 hours of lessons per week.</p>
<p>If you’re one of those crazed parents who want their child to become a tennis pro, you’ll want to send your child to a tennis academy. The prestigious academies down here in Florida, like Bollettieri, Macci, and Evert will cost your child a hefty $40,000 per semester!</p>
