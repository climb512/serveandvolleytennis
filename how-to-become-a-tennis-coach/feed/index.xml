					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s obvious this guy just wants to sell his book.  He has a general idea but I would recommend getting a legitimate certification from either  USPTR or USPTA. Either one is cool.  One is more prevalent on the West Coast but they&#039;re similar and there&#039;s talk of them unifying to better fight the greedy tennis clubs that exploit tennis professionals [not a lot of benefits or health care, they take a huge cut of your lesson fee].
However,  once yet get certified, which includes liability insurance, you&#039;re good to go until you take further training to show that you keep up with the latest trends and knowledge.  Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m very interested in learning to teach tennis for a part-time income. I currently have one student, however, I do not charge him anything. I&#039;m hesitant to bring up the issue of money since he&#039;s only 15 years old, and I&#039;m unsure of his parents financial status. As for myself, I&#039;ve played tennis for the last 43 years and have attained a solid 4.5 level, and at age 62, I feel I am playing the best tennis of my life.]]></description>
