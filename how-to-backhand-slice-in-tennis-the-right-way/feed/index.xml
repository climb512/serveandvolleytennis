					<description><![CDATA[This was excellent!  I too make sure to teach this critically important stroke to all my students--its versatility and high percentage of error makes it an invaluable stroke.  My one small issue would be concerning the use of the back (left for righties) arm at the initiation of the swing forward into the ball&#039;s path.  I would suggest that you emphasize more so that the left arm reach back parallel to the baseline with a feeling of the shoulder blades pinching together at the end of the swing.  In addition:  its important to recognize the &quot;Physics&quot; involved-- as the hands separate, the player is utilizing the Law of Physics that basically states:  &quot;For every action--there is an opposite and equal reaction&quot;....this is where a great deal of the power of the straight hitting arm is derived from...its akin to stretching a rubber band in opposite directions...my point being-the reaching back with the left arm has much more to do with a successful swing than simply acting as a counterbalance.  Again, well done--nice to read instruction that was correct and concise in its detail.]]></description>
