					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/why-you-never-improve-your-tennis-game-and-how-you-can/#comment-1281&quot;&gt;David Hopkins&lt;/a&gt;.

Older players can surprise you. I admire the 70 and 80 year olds at our local court who can still serve well and our volleys away. They don&#039;t move a lot, but with good stroke form, they can still be an asset on the doubles court. Tennis is a lifelong sport. I played 3 sets today, did the grocery shopping, and cleaned my house and I am 56! Yes, I&#039;m tired but as they say,&quot; there is plenty of time to sleep in the grave.&quot; Just get moving!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your comments about older club players lack of physical ability at being able to hit the ball really hard -&quot;they just don&#039;t have it in them&quot; inspired me. As a 64 year old who only started playing tennis a year ago your comments could have made me give up, put my racket on e-bay and take up Bowls or competitive  crochet. What I might lack in physical ability I make up for in guts and determination and I can still get around the court quicker than a lot of players half my age. As a new player its technique that&#039;s my issue, but I can fix that.  I&#039;m not looking to compete on the ATP tour so with respect I&#039;ll ignore your comments and keep playing, doing my best to prove you wrong.   I&#039;m also assuming that you don&#039;t coach and take the money from older clients that you know will never be any good.]]></description>
