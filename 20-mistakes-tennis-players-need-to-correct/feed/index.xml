					<description><![CDATA[I absolutely agree with these &quot;20 Mistakes&quot;. I struggle with “Go Easy On Yourself,” I know to be negative to myself. I get along easily with cheaters, but with obscene behaviour, it&#039;s a little harder. Some people take the game too seriously, they act like they are in a big tournament, they shout during points, they whine, they don&#039;t respect either the game or the opponent. I can&#039;t play with people who annoy me.]]></description>
