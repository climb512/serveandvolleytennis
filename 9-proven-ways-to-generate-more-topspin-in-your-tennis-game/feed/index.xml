					<description><![CDATA[This is interesting. It&#039;s nice of you to have gone all this way to write this, however, there are some things that i have to disagree on, such as the swing path of the racquet. swinging it forward as well doesn&#039;t add much spin to the ball, and unfortunately, gives the ball a rather easy bounce to read. If you are going up the edge of the racquet, and almost pushing back with your front leg, before  bringing you arm around, pointed downwards with a wrist that it cocked inwards (or broken, up to you). I myself am a spin player, and used to hit the ball while swinging forward, but although I could hit hard, the bounces where fairly easy to predict, and were prone to going out. I got coached by someone who has taught top 10 players in the USA, and he&#039;s taught me that doing it this way allows for the ball to bounce a little bit on an angle, due to pushing off with the front leg. You&#039;ll also find that if done properly, the ball still goes really fast, and the bounces can reach well over 6&quot; on a normal rally ball.]]></description>

Thank you. I know a lot of good players who only use an Eastern forehand grip. It&#039;s fine to use. Federer uses it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Chad, i really liked discovering this site, and your training approach. In particular, the idea of “use what works, and throw away the rest”. As a club player in South Africa, I am handicapped with an E grip ; no, married to it neurologically ! Most coaches feel they have to give you a new idea for your training hour, and hence the pupil swings from &#039;windscreen wiper day&#039;, to &#039;belly button to the net day&#039;, to high to low day. Too much information, and nothing integrated on the level of muscle-neuro memory.
What I like about your approach is yes, it is cognitive and analytical, but it gives many ways to approach the same challenge (T/spin ground strokes), and suggest no one action is essential / has to be clung to until you look like a parody of a tennis player. That means you can go out there, pick one or two ideas that resonate with you, and start integrating it / truly making it yourself. Loved that… keep it up !

					<description><![CDATA[Changing racquet tension does not affect spin, but it does affect string movement, dwell time, and ball contact distance. These latter parameters all can affect the ball trajectory as well as the player s feel of the impact. The main advice is that high string tensions make your shot more consistent and make it easier to hit topspin shots. If you do not like the  boardy  feel of high tension strings, then use a lower tension but remember to restring regularly to minimize the affects of undesirable string motion.]]></description>
