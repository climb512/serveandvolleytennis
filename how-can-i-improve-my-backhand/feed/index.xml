					<description><![CDATA[Your articles on tennis are very informative and I learn a lot reading them. However, the comparison between watercolor and oil is a false equivalent.  People think watercolor is an easy and straightforward medium because it&#039;s what kids do in school.  That&#039;s a poor conclusion to draw because they&#039;re not actually using watercolor to even 5% of its potential and capability. Watercolor at its height is a master&#039;s medium because focus on every element is required as in oil, but you have an extremely short window in which to execute.  In oil, you can correct over and over, even days later.  In watercolor there is no such leeway--you have a couple minutes AT MOST. The wetness of the paper changes your mark and when the moment has passed, its gone.  You can correct minor errors but large mistakes require you to start over with a new painting.  So you see, timing, focus,  precision required in watercolor sounds more like tennis than oil, where you can ponder and paint everything in leisure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s an obvious one, but serve and volley is nothing without a solid volley. Most players feel more comfortable with the backhand, but you’ll need to work on your forehand, too.]]></description>
