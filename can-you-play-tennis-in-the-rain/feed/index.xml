					<description><![CDATA[In Seattle, we play almost every day unless rain is falling. A lot of it is heavy mist. We have 5 rollers. Takes about 30 minutes to roll our court and the one next to it (when the angled balls roll there they&#039;ll get wet). We play in cold weather ( 25 f or higher ). Wind up to 20mph. We use hand warmers. We play team tennis (3 vs 3 ). 4 at a time. After one game each team exits a player and the 2 on the bench come in. This rotation makes it so no one sits out more than one game.
Balls get heavy so you have to play a different game. Power doesn&#039;t work. You need smoother strokes or you might hurt your arm.]]></description>
