					<description><![CDATA[I’ve tried to learn s&#038;v before. In fact tried it in practice this morning with a ball machine.  Very frustrating.  I am not amazing at the net but when I come in on a short ball, I do fine.  Is it better to start with chip and charge first?  Which is the first one or two s&#038;v volley plays to learn first?  ie, deuce kick serve down the T to my opponent’s bh (assuming they’re a righty).  My assumption is that it is the best to start with because it is to their bh, kick serve is slower so I can get in closer to the net, and to the T means that my split step locale is easier to get to and they have no angles. 

If I’m correct, what is the next best play to learn?  Better yet, could make for a good article on what order to learn and maybe include a degree of difficulty from 1 to 10. 

Thanks in advance!]]></description>
