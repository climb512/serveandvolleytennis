					<description><![CDATA[Without doubt, Federer is the most talented player ever to play tennis.  Variety of shots he has, is far more than combined of  Nadal or Novak. He is the most beautiful player ever to play tennis. His volley , stop volley, backend, forehand shots are so please to watch. To play for 20 over yrs with very high consistency  is simply amazing. And above all, he is very humble, down to earth always easy going with his fans and reporters. I have hardly  read ppl say bad things abt him. It is astonoshing to know that he has never retired half way in 1300 matches he has played. This shows how much he loves Tennis.. No other player has this effect on public past 50 yrs. No wonder he gets so much respect and attention from players and public.. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44c-1f3fb.png" alt="👌🏻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44c-1f3fb.png" alt="👌🏻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44c-1f3fb.png" alt="👌🏻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>
