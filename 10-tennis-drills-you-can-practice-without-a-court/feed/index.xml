					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the very good tips you give about tennis. Can yu give us some ideas about drills performed with a tennis trainer device (a platform with a elastic rope tied to a ball).
Thank you very much in advance.

					<description><![CDATA[The dribble, while a simple drill, can help your player develop their hand-eye coordination, while at the same time helping them become familiar with the feel of their tennis racquet and developing a sense of touch when contacting the tennis ball. To start, have your player hold their racquet in their dominant hand face-up, like a frying pan, and have them place a tennis ball on the face, or strings of their racquet. Then, have them slowly start moving the head of the racquet up and down until the ball begins bouncing on their strings. Once it starts bouncing, have them keep it bouncing for as long as possible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi There:  I live in CO and am responsible for doing our clubs monthly member newsletter.  Our club is family owned with 4 indoor and 6 outdoor courts.  Since our club is closed due to COVID-19 guidelines, I thought it might be nice to provide our members with something they could do while &quot;Staying at Home&quot; to get ready, hopefully, for the 2020 USTA season.  So, my question to you is if you mind if I copy your verbiage and of course add your byline and a link to your website and add it to our tennis family newsletter?

Thank you for your consideration.]]></description>

Thank you. We&#039;re really glad to hear that. Yes, a racket review for baseline grinders is a great idea. We&#039;ll look to write a blog post like that in the very near future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to tell you how much I enjoy your website and videos. Your instruction is clear and straightforward and based on the realities most of us club level players face (eg lack of great athletic ability etc). I’ve learned a lot. I read your blog on the best racket for serve and volley. I’m a baseline grinder. Any chance of doing a similar review for grinders?  Thx and keep up the great work]]></description>
