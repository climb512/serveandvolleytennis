					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/beginners-serve-vs-advanced-tennis-serve-what-are-the-differences/#comment-712&quot;&gt;Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you for writing this comment that is almost as helpful to me as the article was. You inspire me to keep learning tennis. I&#039;m 51 and just began learning it six months ago. I hope I&#039;m still playing at 82!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting and well explained - thanks. I&#039;m 82 and it&#039;s taken me a couple of years to shift from a waiter&#039;s tray to an advanced serve, albeit one still a bit rough at the edges. In a typical week I&#039;ll spend around 90 minutes three times a week working on serve elements as well as playing a couple of hours once or twice a week, doubles and/or singles.

The major difficulty for me was navigating through different and often conflicting pieces of advice, all of it online, some in the form of free videos others from paid-for courses. AFAIK there is no regulation of tennis coaching and, as with other professional work, membership of a professional association can be but not necessarily is an indication of competence and good teaching practice. Caveat emptor. Keep your critical faculties alert.

So as the article says, it&#039;s possible but difficult for geriatrics like me. What I&#039;d stress is these few aspects following which will make the possible more probable and the difficulty less onerous.

It&#039;s your body, so work within its limitations, principal of which is likely to be shoulder flexibility. If you can&#039;t have the racquet head drop down by your bum, like Djokovic, don&#039;t fret - do what your shoulder allows and over time it will improve. Accept that that Wimbledon championship invite probably won&#039;t come.

And work with your body, not against it. Be as biomechanical as possible within, again, creaky constraints. And don&#039;t believe anyone who tells you that all things have to be done just so. There are major differences between necessary elements of the serve and the styles used to execute them overall and the latter is again very much working with your body and not against it.

Don&#039;t try to do everything at once. There are discrete elements to the serve and it&#039;s best to work on these separately and in most cases until well-developed without introducing the distraction of the ball. Build up gradually. Do lots of shadow swings. Always be critical of what you&#039;re doing and measure it against recommendations and outcomes.

Trust your own body. Relax. And also, importantly, relax. And perhaps the one thing to remember is to relax. The new sensation of your body turning and coiling to store energy and then releasing that kinetic chain of energy smoothly from your feet and legs through your torso up to your shoulder and being left with no choice but having your arm naturally rush to meet the ball perfectly and powerfully with the strings takes some considerable getting used to but it&#039;s an exciting feeling and will bring you great satisfaction when it occurs well and becomes your default way to serve. You&#039;ll get there. But you must relax.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very clearly explained and interesting.  I&#039;m 64, a good club player with quite a strong serve. I&#039;ve found my way to my serve with playing and watching through a lot of these techniques but now I&#039;m inspired to have a go at the jump at the end.  Could be too late but I&#039;ll give it a go in this Covid time when I&#039;m playing singles.  New challenges! Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Super useful article. I have also watched the serving video.

 I am a senior female and although I played tennis as a child and a teenager it has been decades until I started lessons three years ago. 

I love watching pro tennis and therefore can really tell which YouTube and blog tennis lessons are useful. And this one certainly is!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[# 1 men&#039;s/women&#039;s singles University players  (such as at SMU, et. al.?) do not drop the racket head at all on the service toss.  The racket head is simply rotated horizontally behind the head of the player (sometimes before the toss).  This allows the more advanced collegiate player to get the elbow under the ball and the butt of the racket pointed straight up to the sky.   This imparts the maximum amount of upward thrust on the ball and the result is more spin and the ball arcs down into the service box for a reliable serve.  As the author here remarks, the pace of the ball will be somewhat sacrificed vs. a complete drop of the racket head which creates the longest swing path (similar to a golf club&#039;s maximum swing path). Good article.]]></description>
