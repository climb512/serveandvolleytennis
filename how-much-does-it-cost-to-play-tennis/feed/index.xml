					<description><![CDATA[Good evening, 
My name is Loncey Elie and I am 19 years old and a full-time college student at FAU.
I have two important questions.
1. So I found out last year at the age of 18 that I want to become a professional tennis player. I know it sounds crazy because I started playing tennis at the age of 11 but I played for fun. However, when I moved to a new community and received tennis lessons from someone at my neighborhood at the age of 18, I realized this is what I want to become. So if that&#039;s the case, I was wondering in the situation I am currently in by  being a full time college student, is it possible to pursue it and what sacrifices will I have to take to accomplish this goal?
2. In addition, I want to have better training and I know that comes with a high cost to get the best coaching. If I have financial difficulties, what are some of the other avenues I can take to make  my tennis lessons affordable?]]></description>
