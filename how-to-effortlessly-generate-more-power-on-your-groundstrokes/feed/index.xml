You are correct, Brian. I do agree with you that the core drives the rest of the body, including the feet. But it&#039;s helpful for people to know which position to start the feet from. And it&#039;s also helpful to know where they finish. Thanks for leaving a comment and stopping by my blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good article. The legs do not turn the body. They support the body in rotation. All human movement starts in the core and synergistic muscles in the pelvic region. Proximal to distal. It why they can turn so well often with both feet off the ground]]></description>
