					<description><![CDATA[Informative! I struggle with retrievers. Most of the retrievers I play here usually draw me to the net with a short ball. Even though I hit a decent approach they will lob me with a great deep lob that I just watch. I think I have to hit a better slicing approach when I can hit down on it. What do you do lower short balls that are below your knees? I&#039;m thinking a drop shot or place the ball to the open court. Im a little bit older and play younger guys with good speed. So a lot of my shots that I think are really good they get to, get a racket on it and they lob me with a great lob about 65% of the time. Any tips?]]></description>
