					<description><![CDATA[I believe some information in the section &quot;How Does The Serve Work In A Doubles Tie-Breaker?&quot; is incorrect: During regular games in a set, doesn&#039;t every serving double player always start their game &quot;on the deuce side&quot;? I believe the labels &quot;on the deuce side&quot; / &quot;on the ad side&quot; were meant to be in the second and not the first bullet point list of that section, i.e. once the tie-breaker begins.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/why-you-never-improve-your-tennis-game-and-how-you-can/#comment-1281&quot;&gt;David Hopkins&lt;/a&gt;.

Older players can surprise you. I admire the 70 and 80 year olds at our local court who can still serve well and our volleys away. They don&#039;t move a lot, but with good stroke form, they can still be an asset on the doubles court. Tennis is a lifelong sport. I played 3 sets today, did the grocery shopping, and cleaned my house and I am 56! Yes, I&#039;m tired but as they say,&quot; there is plenty of time to sleep in the grave.&quot; Just get moving!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your comments about older club players lack of physical ability at being able to hit the ball really hard -&quot;they just don&#039;t have it in them&quot; inspired me. As a 64 year old who only started playing tennis a year ago your comments could have made me give up, put my racket on e-bay and take up Bowls or competitive  crochet. What I might lack in physical ability I make up for in guts and determination and I can still get around the court quicker than a lot of players half my age. As a new player its technique that&#039;s my issue, but I can fix that.  I&#039;m not looking to compete on the ATP tour so with respect I&#039;ll ignore your comments and keep playing, doing my best to prove you wrong.   I&#039;m also assuming that you don&#039;t coach and take the money from older clients that you know will never be any good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the article and I will try this with a positive approach.
I am 69 and a bit heavy but I still play singles. Years back I beat the number one 4.5 singles player in USTA regionals so at best I was a so so 5.0 player but mostly 4.5 and at my age now a 4.0. I am tall (6&#039;3&quot; ) and I used to hit a 108 mph serve. I struggle to reach 80 mph now. Some older and shorter players hit bigger serves so I am a little annoyed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Howâ€™s it going? Great exercises which Iâ€™ve started incorporating into my workouts. I started the medicine ball throws and did 10 reps each variation, soon afterwards my left side of my back started aching, this was Thursday itâ€™s now Saturday and it doesnâ€™t feel like normal lower back pain, feels more internal. Is there a chance my core got overworked or twisted or something?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi - thanks for this article. Did the sprint session this morning :)

I am exactly as you mention here. Plateau&#039;d after 1.5yrs playing at average club level; and frankly really frustrated. For me the worst thing is losing technique. You briefly mentioned at the end there about consistently maintaining skills; but I&#039;ve been focusing on backhand for couple months and now can no longer seem to hit good forehand; or my serve flow/groove has just gone - not only flagging; but literally have lost it. Makes me want to quit. Do you have any tips on this for someone who does not have 2hrs/day to keep training all strokes? Some days I honestly feel like I am playing about the same as I was 1.5yrs ago!]]></description>
