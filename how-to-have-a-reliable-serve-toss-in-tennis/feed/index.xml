					<description><![CDATA[Hi your advice on the toss is brilliant.  Im mortified at the moment as my toss is so bad. Double after double I release too early, bend my arm and move my hand/fingers. Im slapping down on low tosses that are way off to the right, im almost on the next court I have to reach so far.  Its heartbreaking.  Im trying to keep my arm up after release but Im confused over where my weight  hip/foot should be???  Im just back after 3 months of TE caused by serve.  Btw on occassions I do hit really good serves when the ball is nice and high and in my zone.  Sorry to bother you with all of the above
Many thanks

					<description><![CDATA[That was one of the best serve toss instruction I have ever seen !  Very helpful to me !  I am getting back into tennis after about a 30 year layoff.  Iam 66, and I play against my 33 year old son.  He is 6&#039;3, 215 former hockey player, and a great athlete.  He has been beating up on me pretty badly, but I&#039;m going to kick his ass now !!        Thank you for doing this !]]></description>
