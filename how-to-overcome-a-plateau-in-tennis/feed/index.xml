					<description><![CDATA[Hi - thanks for this article. Did the sprint session this morning :)

I am exactly as you mention here. Plateau&#039;d after 1.5yrs playing at average club level; and frankly really frustrated. For me the worst thing is losing technique. You briefly mentioned at the end there about consistently maintaining skills; but I&#039;ve been focusing on backhand for couple months and now can no longer seem to hit good forehand; or my serve flow/groove has just gone - not only flagging; but literally have lost it. Makes me want to quit. Do you have any tips on this for someone who does not have 2hrs/day to keep training all strokes? Some days I honestly feel like I am playing about the same as I was 1.5yrs ago!]]></description>
