					<description><![CDATA[Hi There

First off, I love the website. It&#039;s really nicely done and I appreciate the YouTube stylings of many of the front cover pictures. This is a really in depth and great resource for coaches and players alike. So nice job man! Thanks for the site :) 

As a coach myself, I think that there just isn&#039;t enough in terms of engaging tennis resources on the web. I wanted to ask you a few questions over LinkedIn or something like that but I couldn&#039;t find you. If you have time to perhaps answer some questions I have as an admirer and web builder, I&#039;d be very grateful.

Thanks again for the great site! Really useful. Going to implement a few things when this whole Corona thing is over.

Keep well!
