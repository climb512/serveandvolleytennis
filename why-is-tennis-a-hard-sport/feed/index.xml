					<description><![CDATA[Hey thank you so much for saying all of this. I am the only tennis player in my grade, and everybody (including my own friends) think I talk about tennis to highly and it’s not very hard. I used this article on them and it changed them. I’ve been playing tennis for as long as I can remember. Everybody has always told me I’m didn’t play a sport when I went out a played for 4-5 hours each day. I’ve worked so hard to become what I am right now at tennis, but no one understands or appreciates it. So thank you for saying all of this.]]></description>
