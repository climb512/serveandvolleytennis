										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The game of tennis might seem complicated for those new to it, but it can essentially be broken down into 8 basic shots. All 8 shots need to be mastered to excel and proceed to the higher levels of tennis.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I discuss all 8 basic shots in the game of tennis. By the time you finish this article, you’ll know all of them inside and out. You’ll also have a much better understanding of the game of tennis.</p>
<p>Here are the 8 basic shots in the game of tennis:</p>

<p>Most tennis newbies wonder, “What are the basic strokes in tennis?” Well now you know. And by knowing all the basic strokes, you can learn them and use them in your own game.</p>
<p>This will make you a more versatile and dangerous player to face. It’s ironic, but I see club players with decades of experience who never utilize all 8 shots in their game.</p>
<p>I believe there are a lot of players out there who never quite learned some of them, so they just don’t use them. If you’re new to tennis, I implore you to learn all 8 basic shots.</p>
<p>Certainly, the forehand, backhand, and serve are essential to playing tennis.</p>
<p>Other shots, like the slice and dropshot, are not part of the arsenal of some club players. I honestly don’t know how they cope in tennis without a slice. To me, the slice on both the forehand and backhand wings are a must-know stroke.</p>
<p>Without more talk, let’s get into the details of each stroke, so you know what each one entails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Basic Forehand Shot</h2>
</div>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1867 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/forehand.jpg" alt="Pat Cash forehand" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/forehand.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/forehand-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/forehand-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The forehand is the most basic and often-used shot in tennis. It’s also the easiest to learn and the shot beginners pick up the quickest.</p>
<p>Think of the forehand as akin to the queen in the game of chess. The forehand is your most versatile shot. Good players can hit with power, spin, and place the ball where they want.</p>
<p>Being the most basic stroke in tennis, it’s often the one everyone learns first. Professional players can dominate matches primarily with their forehand (a la Roger Federer).</p>
<p>The strength and placement of the forehand is often what separates great players at the highest levels. In my experience, the forehand is the most comfortable shot to hit and the most enjoyable too.</p>
<p>The forehand is hit on the dominant side of your body and is typically struck with one arm (your dominant arm). It’s possible to hit a two-handed forehand as well, but I would estimate less than 2% of recreational and professional players use it.</p>

<p>On the men’s pro tour, there have only ever been two players to use the two-handed forehand. And this is out of thousands of players since 1940.</p>
<p>Those two players are the legendary Pancho Segura, and more lately, Fabrice Santoro. Segura was a lot more successful than Santora but played in the 40s and 50s when the game and racket technology was a lot different.</p>
<p>Santoro played in the 90s and 2000s. He reached a career high of 17 and his best result at a major was the quarterfinals of the 2006 Australian Open.</p>
<p>On the women’s side, the two-handed forehand had much more success, with players such as Monica Seles (10 career grand slam titles) and Marion Bartoli. Bartoli won Wimbledon in 2013 and then promptly and unexpectedly retired. She was my favorite woman to watch.</p>
<p>If you’re just starting out in tennis, hire a qualified pro to teach you the basics of the forehand. With just a couple of lessons, you’ll at least know the correct technique.</p>
<p>If you can’t afford lessons or don’t have a qualified pro near you, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHaY0w7QtG205o4ByUHXkEg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out my youtube channel</a> for free forehand lessons.</p>

<h2>The Basic Backhand Shot</h2>
</div>
<div id="attachment_1869" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1869" class="size-full wp-image-1869" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/backhand.jpg" alt="Pablo Cuevas" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/backhand.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/backhand-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/backhand-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1869" class="wp-caption-text">Carine06 from UK [<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0">CC BY-SA 2.0</a>], <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pablo_Cuevas_backhand_(14536242152).jpg">via Wikimedia Commons</a></p></div>
<p>The backhand is hit on the non-dominant side of your body. For example, if you’re a righty and strike the ball on the left side of your body, it’s considered a backhand.</p>
<p>Most player’s backhands are not as strong as their forehand. This is because it’s more difficult to achieve the same level of racket speed on the backhand wing as the forehand side.</p>
<p>However, some players do have better backhands than forehands. If you’re one of those players, then you’re fortunate. Most club players dread hitting their backhands.</p>
<p>I find that most women have better two-handed backhands than forehands. This is likely due to them using more of their core and legs on the backhand. For men, I find most have much better forehands.</p>
<p>The backhand can either be hit with one hand or two. Examples of players with one-handed backhands are Roger Federer, Stan Wawrinka, Carla Suarez Navarro, and Justine Henin (now retired). Some would argue Henin had the best one-handed backhand in the women’s game.</p>
<p>The one-handed backhand offers some pros an advantage over the two-handed backhand. The pros using the one-handed backhand would have greater range of motion, slightly more drive and power, and more versatility with spin.</p>
<p>The cons of the one-handed backhand (compared to the two-) are less control, it’s more difficult to hit high shots, and there’s less ability to hit the ball late. Additionally, it’s more difficult to return serve with a one-hander.</p>
<p>These cons are enough to have persuaded most players and coaches to only teach and hit the two-handed backhand. For this reason, most of the players on the pro level (for both men and women) use a two-handed backhand.</p>
<p>If you wish to reach the upper levels of tennis, it’s essential you develop your backhand into a reliable shot. You’ll need to be able to hit it with depth, spin, placement, and a decent amount of pace.</p>
<p>While it’s not essential you smash winners from the baseline with your backhand, it is essential that it keeps you in the rally. Most professional players use their backhand to stay in a rally long enough to set up their forehand.</p>
<p>If you wish to learn the backhand, I suggest the two-hander. Get a qualified coach to teach you the basics of the shot and then just keep practicing it. I have videos on my youtube channel showing how to hit both the two-hander and the one-hander.</p>

<p><a name="serve"></a></p>
<h2>The Basic Serve</h2>
</div>
<p>Along with the forehand and backhand, the serve is one of the three primary shots in tennis you must know to begin playing. If you can effectively execute all three shots, you can play tennis.</p>
<p>The next shot in tennis you should learn is the volley. If you know these four shots (forehand, backhand, serve, volley) you can play matches, even in tournaments.</p>
<p>It sounds amazing, but you can literally choose to avoid the other four basic shots (drop shot, overhead, slice and lob) and still play competitive tennis. I wouldn’t suggest it though.</p>
<div id="attachment_1871" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1871" class="size-full wp-image-1871" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/serve1.jpg" alt="Andre Agassi serve" width="400" height="610" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/serve1.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/serve1-197x300.jpg 197w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1871" class="wp-caption-text">Srinayan Puppala [<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0">CC BY-SA 2.0</a>], <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Agassi_serve_US_open_05.jpg">via Wikimedia Commons</a></p></div>All tennis players (whether in singles or doubles) get two serves on each point. The first serve is usually hit flat and hard.</p>
<p>The second serve is often hit with topspin or kick. These types of serves have more margin of error and are about 15-20% slower in speed than first serves.</p>
<p>Of the 8 basic shots in tennis, the serve is by far the most difficult to learn and the most complicated. This is for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, the serve is the only shot in tennis where you start and finish the stroke. All other strokes rely on the ball coming to you.</p>
<p>Second, the serve requires you to toss the ball high in the air (usually twice your height) and strike it on the way down. This requires split-second timing.</p>
<p>The toss can also be problematic. This is because it’s done with the non-dominant hand, which can be very difficult for uncoordinated people and beginners.</p>
<p>Third, the serve is a complicated series of movements that must be performed in about two seconds. It also requires knee-bend, flexibility, and high racket speed.</p>
<p>Due to these factors, many club players never develop anything beyond a mediocre serve. This means their serves typically don’t break the 100-mph barrier or possess enough spin to hurt opponents.</p>
<p>If you are just starting out in tennis, realize the serve is a shot that will take you months or years to master. Everyone is limited on the serve by their physical ability, so be aware of that too.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />

<p>If you have dreams of serving 120-mph, unless you’re young and very talented, it’s not likely to happen. Instead, your goal should be a very consistent serve with excellent placement.</p>
<p>The serve is one of those shots you’ll need to continually practice. It requires perfect timing and tremendous hand-eye coordination when hit well.</p>
<p>Some of you may just want to play tennis for the exercise, or for the fun. If that’s your goal, you can use a very simple beginner’s serve to get the ball in the box and start the point.</p>
<p>If that sounds like you, I would advise you to check out my youtube video on the abbreviated serve motion. It’s a beginner’s serve, but slightly more advanced, offering more power and spin.</p>
<p>For those who aspire to hit their serve like Roger Federer, check out my video on Roger Federer’s serve motion. In this video, I explain how to hit your serve like Roger. Just don’t blame me if you can’t.</p>

<h2>The Basic Volley</h2>
</div>
<div id="attachment_1873" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1873" class="size-full wp-image-1873" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/volley.jpg" alt="Jo-Wilfried Tsonga" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/volley.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/volley-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/volley-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1873" class="wp-caption-text">Kate from UK [<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0">CC BY-SA 2.0</a>], <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jo-Wilfried_Tsonga_Wimbledon_2011_jump_volley.jpg">via Wikimedia Commons</a></p></div>
<p>The volley is unique all to itself. At its most basic element, it doesn’t require any swing of the racket or much body movement at all. Yet, it can be one of the most difficult shots in tennis to master.</p>
<p>What is a volley? A volley is when a player hits the ball directly out of the air, instead of letting the ball bounce first. When the ball bounces first, it’s called a “rally”. When taken in the air, it’s called a volley.</p>
<p>The volley is a very short compact “block” of the ball, most often close to the net. The volley can be hit on either the forehand side or the backhand side.</p>
<p>One of the reasons so few players master the volley is the very short amount of time provided to hit the ball. When you’re up at net, the ball is coming to you much sooner than at the baseline.</p>
<p>This makes it largely a reflexive shot, while baseline groundstrokes are much more deliberate.</p>
<p>Even the best players in the world today prefer not to come to net. The pace of groundstrokes at the pro level is just too much to handle, even for the best volley players.</p>
<p>With groundstroke speeds coming in excess of 80-90 mph, it’s very difficult to hit effective volleys, much less get a racket on the ball. For this reason, we have seen a trend away from net play over the last generation.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about this, I wrote an article entitled <a href="/why-did-serve-and-volley-die-out/">Why Did The Serve And Volley Die Out</a>?  It’s an interesting look at why the volley declined in both the women’s and men’s game over the last 20 years.</p>
<p>Despite the volley dying out, all players must learn to volley. This is because if you’re forced into net, you’ll have no choice but to eventually volley. The volley is also an essential part of doubles, which many people play.</p>
<p>If you’ve been struggling with your volleys, have no fear. I wrote a great blog post about the <a href="/seven-volley-types-you-must-know-to-master-your-net-game/">7 types of volleys</a> to use in your game. By knowing all 7 types and how to hit them, you’ll instantly improve your net game.</p>
<p>I also have a bunch of volley videos on my youtube channel. I recommend starting off with the block volley and then working your way through the other 6 volley types.</p>
<p>On the volley, always remember less is more. Most people over-complicate the volley and do too much swinging. The volley is more about great footwork and less about what you do with your racket.</p>
<p>If you want to play good doubles, or be an offensive player in singles, it’s imperative you learn to hit volleys with pace, spin, touch, and placement. It all comes in time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="anchor">
<p><a name="slice"></a></p>
<h2>The Basic Slice</h2>
</div>
<p>Traditional forehand and backhand strokes are hit with topspin (forward rotation of the ball). However, the slice employs backspin, which is a backward rotation of the ball.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it can also involve side spin.</p>
<p>The slice can be hit on either wing: the forehand or backhand. It can also be hit with either two hands or one. However, most players (probably more than 95%) hit their slice with one hand.</p>
<p>The slice generally refers to the downward motion of the racket when contacting the ball. The downward motion is what causes the backspin on the ball.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to traditional groundstrokes, which use a low-to-high swing path. In my opinion, it’s more difficult to learn the slice though.</p>
<p>I can teach a child or adult to make solid contact on a traditional forehand or backhand, but the slice is a different animal. For this reason, it can take a long time to develop a penetrating, effective slice shot on both wings.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the difficulty level is the downward motion of the swing. Most beginners aren’t used to contacting the ball like that. The continental grip used on the slice also throws people off.</p>
<div id="attachment_1875" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1875" class="size-full wp-image-1875" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/slice.jpg" alt="Federer hitting a slice." width="400" height="404" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/slice.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/slice-297x300.jpg 297w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1875" class="wp-caption-text">Steve Collis from Melbourne, Australia [<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0">CC BY 2.0</a>], <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Federer_2009_Australian_Open_crop.jpg">via Wikimedia Commons</a></p></div>Most players open the racket face too much, or too early, and float the ball on their slice. For this reason, I teach my students to hit the ball completely flat but with a high-to-low trajectory of the racket.</p>
<p>If the slice is hit well, it can be a very damaging shot to the opponent. A good slice will skid on the ground and stay low. It can also be difficult to volley a tightly rotating slice.</p>
<p>Most players use the slice as a defensive shot, but it can certainly be used offensively as well. One example of an offensive slice shot is the approach shot. This is a hard, low slice away from the opponent.</p>
<p>On an approach shot, a player will quickly come to net in hopes of putting away an easy volley. The former greats like Pete Sampras, Patrick Rafter, and Stefan Edberg all used this tactic.</p>
<p>Many players also use the slice on the return of serve. I find the slice to be an excellent way to neutralize fast serves. It’s also much easier to control a slice return than a topspin return on fast or high serves.</p>
<p>The downside of returning a serve with a slice is that your opponent could volley it for a winner. But that’s only if they are a serve and volley type player. If you’re playing a strict baseliner, it’s a good tactic for the return.</p>
<p>The slice is an excellent way to handle high shots too (balls higher than your shoulder level). This is especially true on the backhand side, where there is less flexibility and strength to hit the ball high up.</p>
<p>For this reason, you’ll see many professional players turn to the slice on the high backhand. I personally use the slice to great effect on my forehand wing too – mostly on high shots.</p>
<p>The slice is also a great way to change up the spin on the ball. In this way, you offer different looks to your opponent, so they never know what to expect.</p>
<p>Lastly, the slice is often used as a last resort when the ball is far from the body. This typically happens when a ball is hit far from us and we are on the run to it.</p>
<p>Being it’s nearly impossible to hit a traditional groundstroke when so out of position, players will simply slice the ball back, as it’s the only option. When done on the forehand side, some call it a “squash shot”.</p>
<p>Roger Federer probably hits the best “squash shot” in the game. He also has one of the best slices the game has ever seen, period.</p>
<p>If you play tennis but haven’t developed a slice – or a good slice – work with a coach who can show you the shot. I have a great blog post here on <a href="/how-to-backhand-slice-in-tennis-the-right-way/">how to hit a backhand slice</a>.  I’ll be adding one for the forehand slice soon.</p>

<p><a name="overhead"></a></p>
<h2>The Basic Overhead Shot</h2>
</div>
<p>The overhead is a shot you hit above your head. It’s very similar to the serve motion, except the ball will be hit at you, instead of you initiating the stroke.</p>
<p>Overheads can be hit directly out of the air or after they hit the ground. If taken out of the air, exquisite timing is necessary to hit an effective overhead.</p>
<p>On occasion, it’s wise to let the ball hit the ground first and not take it out of the air. If the ball bounces high enough, you can strike the ball over your head.</p>
<p>Allowing the ball to hit the ground first is a lot easier than taking it out of the air. However, most of the time you’ll want to hit the ball out of the air.</p>
<div id="attachment_1877" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1877" class="size-full wp-image-1877" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/overhead.jpg" alt="Rafael Nadal hitting an overhead shot." width="400" height="599" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/overhead.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/overhead-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1877" class="wp-caption-text">Carine06 from UK [<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0">CC BY-SA 2.0</a>], <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flickr_-_Carine06_-_Rafa_overhead.jpg">via Wikimedia Commons</a></p></div>It’s really a judgment call which one you choose. The more you play, the easier it becomes to decide. You’re much more likely to hit the ball out of the air when you’re at net and lobbed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my belief that if you have a good serve motion, you’ll have a good overhead. The fundamentals of the serve and overhead are basically the same.</p>
<p>However, if your serve fundamentals are lacking, your overheads are going to be spotty at best. I believe a good racket drop is crucial to hitting great overheads. The racket drop is when your racket inverts before swinging up to contact.</p>
<p>If you have a beginner’s serve, also known as a waiter’s serve, you’ll likely never have world-class overheads. But you can still make do and place the ball well.</p>
<p>The overhead requires good footwork and great timing. Most people miss their overheads because their footwork does not put them in proper position to hit the ball well.</p>
<p>When you see a ball lobbed to you, your first instinct should be to turn to your forehand side and get your racket up. This is the side from which you hit your forehands and serves.</p>
<p>From here, you’ll want to use a cross-step as your first move. Once done, side-step back into position to hit the perfect overhead.</p>
<p>A major mistake I often see is people walking backwards to hit the overhead. They clearly missed the first step of turning to their side. This rarely works and can result in you falling over and hurting yourself.</p>
<p>With the right footwork and practice, you can make the overhead one of your best shots. If you can put your overheads away with pace and placement, it’ll put a ton of pressure on your opponents – especially when you come to net.</p>
<p>I should mention that the overhead can be hit on the backhand side as well. It’s rare, but most professional players can put away balls using a backhand overhead. A lot of it involves a flick of the wrist.</p>
<p>However, most club players find the backhand overhead shot to be very difficult. It’s still worth practicing, as you’ll experience hitting it from time-to-time in your matches. It involves using a combination of your arm and wrist.</p>
<p>The normal overhead is an important shot to learn in tennis and will serve you well in both singles and doubles. Most people don’t practice the overhead enough. I suggest working on it every practice session, if even for 5-10 minutes.</p>

<h2>The Basic Drop Shot</h2>
</div>
<p>When done right, the drop shot is an extremely effective shot that can win you a point outright. It is often made from the baseline, whereby a player hits the ball very slowly with a lot of backspin.</p>
<p>Optimally, the ball will go barely over the net, not more than 5-6 feet into the court, and have very little forward movement. This will force the opposing player to sprint up to the ball and hit it.</p>
<p>This causes difficultly for the opposing player for several reasons. One is that the ball may be out of reach, whereby you win the point outright. Second, the opposing player must run fast and stop in time to avoid hitting the net.</p>
<p>If that player touches the net with their body or racket after hitting the ball, they automatically lose the point. Third, most good drop shots will cause the opposing player to lift the ball over the net, making it difficult to hit a good shot back on you.</p>
<div id="attachment_1865" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1865" class="size-full wp-image-1865" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dropshot.jpg" alt="Boris Becker drop shot" width="400" height="267" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dropshot.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dropshot-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dropshot-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1865" class="wp-caption-text">James Phelps from USA [<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0">CC BY 2.0</a>], <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Boris_Becker_in_action.jpg">via Wikimedia Commons</a></p></div>The drop shot can be hit off either side – forehand or backhand. It can be used at any time during the point, even off the serve. As a matter of fact, it can be very effective off the serve.</p>
<p>I like to throw in at least a few drop shots per set – usually in my baseline rallies. I do this for several reasons. One, it keeps the opposing player honest; he or she never knows what to expect from me.</p>
<p>Second, it makes the opposing player sprint to net, which expends their energy. This makes them just a bit more tired during the rest of the match.</p>
<p>I especially like to drop shot my opponent in the first set, as it will tire them out in the second set, and possibly the third (if we go there). If you want to compare it to boxing, drop shots are like body blows.</p>
<p>Even if the opponent gets to my drop shot and wins the point, it takes a small physical toll on them. In boxing, a fighter may land body shots early in the fight, but they typically don’t pay off until the later rounds. Same thing in tennis.</p>
<p>The drop shot can be used in these different scenarios: off the serve (as I just mentioned), during a baseline rally, and when you’re at net hitting a volley (called a drop volley). Another really good time to use the drop shot is off a drop shot.</p>
<p>That last scenario may sound confusing, so I’ll clarify. Let’s say your opponent drop shots you and you sprint up to the net to hit the ball. Usually your best option at that point is to drop your opponent right back.</p>
<p>Why? Because it’s often unexpected and your opponent will need to cover a large distance to get to the ball. It’s also easier to drop shot from the net rather than the baseline.</p>
<p>The drop shot requires a more delicate touch than any other shot in tennis. If you’re playing against a fast player who anticipates well, you’ll have a slim margin of success with the drop shot.</p>
<p>The danger of the drop shot occurs when it’s hit too deep or too high. If this happens, expect your opponent to easily get up to it and hit a clear winner on you.</p>
<p>As this can happen, it’s an excellent idea to disguise your drop shot. You do this by making it look like you’re going to hit your normal forehand or backhand.</p>
<p>At the last second you pull the rug out from under your opponent and slice the ball short. If you can learn to disguise your dropper, you’ll have a lot more success with it.</p>
<p>I think the number one reason players fail when using the drop shot is that they telegraph it. Most have no idea they’re showing their hand a mile away – as their opponents are usually mum to the fact.</p>
<p>One more point about the drop shot: It can be a great way to get a baseline player who hates the net out of his element.</p>
<p>By dropping such players, you force them to play the net, where their weakest. This is a great strategy to use against a perennial baseline player.</p>
<p>Practicing the drop shot is quite easy. Just rally at the baseline with your hitting partner. After one or two shots, hit a drop shot. You can also practice it on a ball machine.</p>

<h2>The Basic Lob</h2>
</div>
<div id="attachment_1880" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1880" class="wp-image-1880 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/lob2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/lob2.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/lob2-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/lob2-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1880" class="wp-caption-text"><a title="Running down a lob" href="https://flickr.com/photos/mirsasha/5000452102">&#8220;Running down a lob&#8221;</a> by <a href="https://flickr.com/people/mirsasha">mirsasha</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lob is chiefly a defensive tennis shot. In tennis, a lob is a slow-moving shot hit at a high trajectory. Its purpose is to go over the head of a net player – or make the net player hit a difficult shot.</p>
<p>Some people even go so far as to use the lob in rallies. While that can work at the lower levels of tennis, it doesn’t work at the intermediate level &#8211; and certainly not at the advanced level.</p>
<p>I suggest only lobbing when the opposing player is at the net or when you’re far out of position and off the court. The latter works well to give yourself time to get back into the point.</p>
<p>Lobbing when you’re off the court is especially effective if the opposing player doesn’t like to move off the baseline. I use this tactic a lot when I’m strung wide against a perennial baseline player.</p>
<p>The lob can be hit off any side, forehand or backhand. It is most often hit with topspin but can be hit with slice as well. A topspin lob is much preferred and more effective for three distinct reasons.</p>
<p>One is that the topspin will help keep the ball in the court. Two, it’s more difficult for your opponent to hit a fast spinning ball that is dipping quickly; slice shots tend to float more and are much easier to hit.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can lob with more pace and margin of error with a topspin as opposed to slice. To hit the lob, simply brush on the bottom of the ball and finish your stroke up high. You’ll be taking almost all the pace off the ball and putting that energy into the “brush”.</p>
<p>Keep in mind it’s always more effective to lob your opponent on his or her backhand side. The backhand overhead is a much tougher shot to hit than the normal overhead.</p>
<p>You can make the lob more even more effective if you disguise it well. Do this by preparing the same way you would on any forehand or backhand. Instead of hitting with your normal stroke, put a lot of brush on the ball.</p>
<p>Lobbing is a good strategy but it’s not the cure-all to beat a player that likes to come to net on you. Instead, it’s best to mix in hard shots and heavy topspin shots with your lobs.</p>
<p>This throws your opponent off and will keep them guessing. If you’re playing outside and it’s very windy, take note of which way the wind is blowing.</p>
<p>My best advice on a windy day is not to lob into the wind. I find it to be very challenging to hit a lob when the wind is against me.</p>
<p>If I lob into the wind, the ball will not be very deep, and my opponent will crush it. On the contrary, lobbing with the wind is advisable.</p>
<p>You just need be careful not to put too much on the ball. When hitting a lob with the wind at your back, hit lightly and let the wind do the work.</p>
<p>You can practice your lobs as easily as your drop shots. Just have someone stand at the net and see how well you can lob them. Practice over-and-over on both forehand and backhand wings. Do this until you’re a master of the topspin lob off of both sides.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This wraps up the 8 basic shots in tennis. I hope this post has given you a good insight into each stroke. My point was to give some information on each stroke to all level of players.</p>
<p>If you’re new to tennis, take your time learning each stroke. Tennis is a difficult game to learn and master. Give yourself several years to reach an intermediate level.</p>
<p>For those experienced players reading this, if you’re not using all 8 basic shots in your game, you’re selling yourself short. For example, if you’ve never sliced, or don’t believe you can do it well, take on the challenge of learning it.</p>
<p>It will add great depth to your game. Remember, always make sure you know the fundamentals and are executing them properly. If you can’t get a coach, at least video your strokes so you can see where corrections need to be made.</p>
<p>Hey, I have a lot of cool and interesting articles on this blog, so don’t be afraid to browse around and check them out. I’ve categorized most of them into “training” and “theory”.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming this far with me. If you have any questions on these basic strokes of tennis post them in the comment section below. And don’t forget to check out my youtube channel for great tips and tricks to accelerate your tennis game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you want to hit a slice, do you? You see Federer ripping backhand slices to his opponents and he makes it look so easy. But as you may have discovered, it’s not.</p>
<p>Hitting the backhand slice can be very challenging for beginner players. This is because you need to put backspin on the ball and still hit with pace.</p>
<p>Heck, even intermediate players can struggle with their backhand slice. But why?</p>
<p><strong>It’s because the slice is hit with a continental grip and from high-to-low, unlike the other groundstrokes. Often beginners end up opening their racket face too much. This causes the ball to pop up and lack pace, which is the most common issue on the slice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here are the keys to hitting a great backhand slice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continental grip</strong></li>
<li><strong>An exaggerated shoulder turn and high take back of the racket</strong></li>
<li><strong>Swinging from high to low</strong></li>
<li><strong>Contacting the ball with a slightly open racket face</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keeping to the side on the swing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Following through in the right position</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While the stroke looks easy to pull off, there’s a lot that goes into it. And a lot can go wrong with it as well. I’ve broken the backhand slice down into six steps, which are listed below.</p>
<p>Go through each step slowly. Get each one correct before moving to the next. If you follow my instructions, you’ll be hitting smooth backhand slices in no time.</p>
<h2>How To Hit The Backhand Slice</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_1251" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1251" class="size-full wp-image-1251" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0176.jpg" alt="The Ready Position." width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0176.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0176-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0176-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0176-560x315.jpg 560w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1251" class="wp-caption-text">The Ready Position.</p></div>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Before you hit any shot in tennis, you’ll want to be in the ready position. Your body should be facing the net with toes pointing forward. Feet are slightly wider than shoulder width, knees bent slightly.</p>
<p>Once you decide to hit the backhand slice, position your hitting hand into the continental grip on the racket. This is essentially the hammer grip with the pointer finger knuckle on the second bevel.</p>
<p>This grip will place the strings in a slightly open position at contact. The nondominant hand should hold the throat of the racket. The grip of both hands should be a medium squeeze, neither too light or too hard.</p>
<p>This is all you need to do for step one. But let me give you a few caveats about the slice, which are often the result of grip issues. This could save you a lot of time and frustration later.</p>
<p>The tricky thing about the slice is making sure the racket face is at the perfect angle when contacting the ball. You may, therefore, need to adjust your hand ever so slightly on the grip if the ball is not being hit flush.</p>
<p>The angle of the racket face should be slightly open at contact – no more than 10 degrees. If the face is straight on, you can still slice the ball if you swing high to low. But if the face is too open or too closed, it won’t work.</p>

<a class="thumbnail" href='/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0180.jpg'><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0180.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="A unit turn to your backside, side view." srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0180.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0180-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0180-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0180-560x315.jpg 560w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – There’s a ton of information in this step, so pay attention. If you watch the video I made and read this blog post, it’s probably best for learning.</p>
<p>While video is awesome, I like writing these blog posts, as I can fill in all the details that video usually lacks. Okay, now onto step two.</p>
<p>You’re going to make a strong unit turn of your upper body to your backhand side. Raise the racket up to head level. I like to bring my hands up to eye level.</p>
<p>Keep your elbows away from your body. I see a lot of players keeping their elbows close to their body on groundstrokes, which is incorrect. This is an important tip for all groundstrokes when getting into the power position.</p>
<p>As you make the unit turn, your head should still be somewhat facing the net. This takes some dexterity and will probably be easier for younger players. Turn as much as possible without straining your neck.</p>
<p>When I first started teaching, many adults told me they couldn’t turn very far because their necks would strain when trying to keep their heads forward. If you learn to play at an early age, it just seems natural, so it surprised me to hear this.</p>
<p><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1377479784047452" data-ad-slot="5908684722"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>Keep in mind, we all need to work within the limitations of our bodies. So only turn as much as comfortable.</p>
<p>After your unit turn, your opponent should be able to see your back. Your hands and racket should be behind you and up high. The hitting hand and racket will be close to your neck. Your eyes should be looking at the court.</p>
<p>The butt cap of the racket should be facing to your left. As for the angle of the racket face, I like to point the hitting strings toward the sky, like Dominic Thiem. You can have the hitting face at a 45-degree angle if you want, pointing half-way to the sky and half-way to the net.</p>
<p>Your feet will pivot to the left (if you are right-handed) and your right foot will be on the toes. This will place most of your weight on your left foot. If you are left-handed, simply do the opposite of the instructions in this post.</p>

<a class="thumbnail" href='/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0172.jpg'><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0172.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="Step forward and left with the right foot (front view)." srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0172.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0172-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0172-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0172-560x315.jpg 560w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>
<a class="thumbnail" href='/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0181.jpg'><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0181.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="Step forward and left with the right foot (side view)." srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0181.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0181-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0181-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0181-560x315.jpg 560w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> – At this point, you should feel a good stretch on the right side of your body. Now here comes the point at which we step into the shot.</p>
<p>I want you to hold everything in the same position. The only change is that we’re going to step forward and to the left with our right foot. This will place our right foot about 18 inches in front of the left (meaning 18 inches closer to the net).</p>
<p>The heel of the right foot should be around the toes of the left foot. This will place our feet in perfect alignment to hit the slice.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that when you hit the slice for real, you’ll want to step in as you hit the ball. This helps transfer your weight forward. In other words, you won’t step, wait a couple of seconds and then hit. It should all be one continuous motion.</p>
<p>For now, we’re going through the backhand slice, step-by-step, so you can learn it.</p>

<a class="thumbnail" href='/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0173.jpg'><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0173.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="Swing forward and down from the Power Position (front view)." srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0173.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0173-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0173-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0173-560x315.jpg 560w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>
<a class="thumbnail" href='/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0182.jpg'><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0182.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full" alt="Swing forward and down from the Power Position (side view)." srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0182.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0182-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0182-768x432.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0182-560x315.jpg 560w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – You’re now in the full power position of the backhand slice. This is the optimal position to swing the racket down and forward to contact.</p>
<p>When we initiate the swing, we can keep our feet in the same position. The only difference is that our weight will be transferring from left foot to right foot during the swing. This is crucial for maximizing power.</p>
<p>Begin the swing by letting go of the racket with the left hand. The swing path of the racket will be forward and slightly down. One beginner error I see here is overemphasizing the downward part of the swing too early. Think more straight on than down if this problem is happening with you.</p>
<p>As the hitting arm moves from behind you towards your body, it should completely straighten. A straight arm on contact gives us more power.</p>
<p>One point about the role of the left arm. After letting go of the racket with the left hand, move the left arm back to stabilize the body. Don’t just let it hang at your side.</p>
<div id="attachment_1265" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1265" class="size-full wp-image-1265" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0183.jpg" alt="Contact the ball with the racket face open about 10 degrees." width="800" height="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0183.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0183-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0183-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1265" class="wp-caption-text">Contact the ball with the racket face open about 10 degrees.</p></div>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> – Contact the ball with the racket face open about 10 degrees. This means the strings will be pointed upwards slightly at contact.</p>
<p>This is a very crucial part of the backhand slice. If the racket face is too open the ball will pop up with no pace. If too closed, you’ll end up hitting the frame.</p>
<p>A big mistake I see here is players opening the face well past 10 degrees. Often, they have no idea how much they are opening the face and can’t correct it. This makes it difficult to hit the slice.</p>
<p>If this is you, I have a drill that can help. Step over to the fence for a moment. Get relatively close and initiate a slice, swinging your racket into the fence.</p>
<p>Do it slowly and see what position the racket face is at when it strikes the fence. This will your contact point. For the sake of this drill, try to keep your racket face completely straight-on to the fence at contact.</p>
<p>There’s a reason I want your strings to be directly impacting the fence head-on. This will exaggerate a closed racket face, which will counter keeping the face too open. Shadow swing into the fence 15-20 times or until it feels comfortable.</p>
<p>Now back to the court and the action.</p>
<p>Once you contact the ball, keep the arm moving forward and down. By doing this, your arm will automatically move to the right side of your body, which is where it should go.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong> – Keep your body maintained in the same side position as long as possible. Once the racket moves across your body, it will feel natural to square the shoulders to the net.</p>
<p>Squaring the shoulders at this point is fine. But if you square up too early (before the racket is nearly finished moving), you’ll compromise the stroke. This is another common issue beginner players have with the backhand slice. I called it opening up too soon.</p>

<p>Now, if you’ve done the stroke correctly, your weight should be completely on your front foot (right). If you want to add more power to the slice, you can slide your left foot under your right, kind of like bowlers do.</p>
<p>We need to slide up our left foot because the right foot still has the weight on it. Sliding up the left foot is not necessary to hit a powerful slice, but it does help.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that after your hitting arm is near completion, it will raise up. This is natural. I think of the slice as an up-down-up motion.</p>
<p>The arm does raise back up on most shots towards the end. This is just the natural biomechanics of the body at work.</p>
<p>At the end of the stroke, the hitting face of the racket should be pointed to the sky. However, in some instances, the hitting side will finish facing the net.</p>
<p>There are no one-size-fits-all rules in tennis when it comes to strokes. The strokes will always vary slightly depending on the player and what situation he or she is in.</p>
<p>As an example, you might see Federer hit his backhand slice in five different ways. But each one is hit from a different position, so they’ll vary.</p>

<h2>Backhand Slice – Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>I’ve given you step-by-step details on how hit the backhand slice. Look at the pictures and check out the video as well. The combination of all three will give you a great idea of how to hit the shot.</p>
<p>Here’s my advice on how to practice the backhand slice. First, I would go through each step. Start with step one and slowly make your way to step six. Practice slowly by yourself. If you do it at home in front of a full-length mirror, that would be ideal.</p>
<p>Once you can put all the steps together and blend them into one stroke, shadow swing the backhand slice at least 100 times. After you do at least 100 reps, you can take it out to the court.</p>
<p>If you’re alone, you can use a tennis ball machine to practice your stroke. Or, if you don’t have access to a ball machine, go to a wall. If you have a practice partner, have your partner toss or hit you slow, high balls to your backhand.</p>
<p>You may want to start in the power position at first. Once you feel comfortable working from there, you can start in the ready position and perform the whole stroke.</p>
<p>I just taught the backhand slice to a 10-year-old student of mine. She’s a good player and caught on quickly. I used all the information in this post in our lesson. It worked beautifully and I’m certain she’s going to take a step up in her tennis game by adding the slice.</p>
<p>Early in the lesson, and as I expected, she opened her racket face too much on contact during the first hits. So I took her over to the fence and we worked on the drill I shared with you earlier.</p>
<p>The fence drill helped, and she kept the racket face closed more on contact. Within 10 minutes she was hitting good backhand slices.</p>
<p>They had backspin and were landing deep to the other side of the court. The only thing they lacked was pace. But that comes in time. In only one lesson, she was hitting the backhand slice!</p>
<p>I tell you this because I believe anyone can learn the backhand slice. And it shouldn’t take long to learn either.</p>

<h2>Uses For The Backhand Slice</h2>

<p>Now, using the backhand slice in a match is different. In a match, you’ll be on the run and under pressure. I would suggest using it in practice first and then trying it in a match.</p>

Here are times you’ll want to use the backhand slice during a match:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you receive a very high ball to your backhand side</li>
<li>When you want to “chip and charge”. This entails hitting a slice and coming to net.</li>
<li>On the return of serve. This is especially true when the ball kicks up high.</li>
<li>When you’re on the defensive and don’t have time to set up for a topspin backhand.</li>
<li>When the ball is too low and far in front of you to hit a topspin backhand. On these occasions, the slice is usually your only option.</li>
<li>When you’re tired. The slice will allow you to hit a deep shot back to your opponent with less effort than a topspin backhand.</li>
<li>When you want to vary the spin or change up the tempo on your opponent.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re serious about improving in tennis, you’ll definitely need to add the backhand slice to your arsenal. I just gave you seven different reasons why you would use it in a match.</p>
<p>All the top players in the world work the backhand slice into their games – and quite often. If you’re a one-handed backhand player, it’s almost mandatory you learn the slice. This is the only way you can handle the high shots.</p>
<p>Why You Should Learn The Backhand Slice</p>
<p>Hitting balls up high to your backhand is one of the most uncomfortable shots in tennis. The slice makes it a lot easier. By slicing, we can hit strong, effective shots that come high to our backhand wing.</p>
<p>What I like about the slice is that it can be used equally effectively on any height shot. You can hit high balls, medium height shots, and even low balls with the slice. All can be hit hard and with good spin.</p>
<p>Most consider the slice a defensive shot, but it can also be used offensively, like on the chip and charge. The overall effect of the slice is to keep the ball skidding low. This forces your opponent to hit a low shot and usually robs them of time.</p>

<p>I’ve played against great players who hit almost all their backhands with slice. I can specifically recall two (Manny and Charlie). Manny’s a 5.5 player who exclusively hits backhand slice. I didn’t think it was possible to play at 5.5 level without a great topspin backhand, but Manny proved otherwise.</p>
<p>Manny has the best and most effective slice I’ve ever seen. It comes in fast with tons of underspin. Trying to volley it at the net was almost pointless. It was so good he never needed to hit a topspin backhand.</p>
<p>Charlie’s slice is also excellent but doesn’t have as much spin or pace as Manny’s. That’s not to say it doesn’t. It has excellent spin and pace.</p>
<p>But Charlie places his slices better. He can slice deep to the baseline or to the middle of the court. Even more tricky, his slice and drop shot look identical, so you never know if he’s dropping. This one wins him a lot of easy points.</p>
<p>I share my experience with these players with you for a reason. And that is to inspire you to learn the slice. For those who have a terrible topspin backhand, take comfort in knowing that you can still reach a good level in tennis (4.0-5.0) with a strong slice.</p>
