					<description><![CDATA[I play with the Maxply McEnroe.  What is your assessment of that racquet for S&#038;V?  It was made for him but I have always been perplexed by its 68 stiffness rating and 16x19 string pattern?  Was the stiffness for him to have better stability at net against big hitters?  It’s only 3 HL but weight can be added into the grip and yet the head is only 98si with a beam of 21.  Please elaborate when you can if this is still a good S&#038;V racquet despite some of its contradictory specs?  Or did I get taken?
Thank you,
Darin]]></description>
