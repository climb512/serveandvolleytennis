					<description><![CDATA[Great article; one I&#039;ve considered writing myself for years. Thank you!
I was a pro in the mid-80s through late 90s (taught for a few more years), getting hooked as I came up in the 70s, watching the great battles between Mac, Borg, Lindl, Connors, Sampras...like Pat Rafter (who ended up doing it much better), I loved S&#038;V, and wanted nothing more than to live and die at the net. The contrast in the different styles was what I loved. I loved seeing otherwise unknown players in the late rounds of Wimbledon (Shuzo Matsuoka, anyone?) or the French (how about Christophe Roger-Vasselin?). I can&#039;t even watch tennis anymore; the homogenization of styles killed it for me. I disagree with the powers who decided people wanted all-baseliners. Changing Wimbledon&#039;s grass??? Sacrilege!!! Slowing down hard courts, which were already &quot;the Great Equalizer&quot; between clay and grass? Madness! I really hope that you are right, and that S&#038;V comes back...with a vengeance!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like your website and message very much! The sport of Tennis needs to keep the spirit and gamestyle of SERVE-AND-VOLLEY alive! This is why I created the ONE-ON-ONE DOUBLES Tournaments in 2004. This crosscourt serve and volley Singles game mandates the serve and volley rule on both serves. Players earn a two point bonus for winning volleys and overheads the opponent cannot reach. There is plenty of Serve and Volley success within this competitive space. As we know, for all the reasons this website author mentions, many think it is too hard/ risky to S&#038;V on a full court. It is not! However, a player should become efficient and confident with their One-On-One Doubles Skills FIRST to establish the foundation for a successful, all-court, Serve and Volley Singles &#038; Doubles game.

					<description><![CDATA[This is 2021 and most players effectively serve-and-volley and attack the net behind an approach shot. Last decades, going to the net was a suicide, not because the tactic was dead, but because most players just didn&#039;t have enough skills and experience to execute it. Nowadays, no one goes exclusively serve-and-volleying like Edberg or Sampras but effective net-play has made its way back as essential tactic that every pro has to train for. I&#039;m watching Italian Open and even on this slow clay, virtually every player gets to the net on occasions. And it&#039;s a lot more interesting to watch than baseline-exclusive game.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article about serve and volley. I always wondered why it has not come back in vogue. You did an excellent job of answering my question. I hope you are right that someday it will make a comeback. The baseline pro tennis that everyone plays even on the level of Nadal and company gets old.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well Taylor Townsend&#039;s run should be interesting to you.... Being different sometimes works in your favor and when the Top 3 seeds are out on women&#039;s side of the draw she has a chance to do the unthinkable.

 Tennis needs variety. Yeah long rallies by ball strikes from the baseline does lead more excitement (I guess since I only watch majors and Indian Wells) but at what cost? Tennis is dominated by tall women and tall men who stand behind the baseline and murder the ball.]]></description>
