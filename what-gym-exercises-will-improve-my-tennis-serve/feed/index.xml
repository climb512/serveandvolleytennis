					<description><![CDATA[I like the article and I will try this with a positive approach.
I am 69 and a bit heavy but I still play singles. Years back I beat the number one 4.5 singles player in USTA regionals so at best I was a so so 5.0 player but mostly 4.5 and at my age now a 4.0. I am tall (6&#039;3&quot; ) and I used to hit a 108 mph serve. I struggle to reach 80 mph now. Some older and shorter players hit bigger serves so I am a little annoyed.]]></description>
